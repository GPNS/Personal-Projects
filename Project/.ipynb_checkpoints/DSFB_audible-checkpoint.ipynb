       "' ...all books by this author!!! Full of facts and verifiable truths! It\\'s just too bad that the opposition won\\'t even listen to the truth because of how badly they\\'ve been deceived and their devotion to the deceivers!!! As an introverted teenager in the 80s, I was obsessed with Andrew, Molly, Jon, Judd, and Ali... and of course the movies they made. Andrews take on introversion and disassociating to mask insecurity was especially relatable and validated my own uncomfortable experiences, growing up shy, reserved, aloof, and unavailable. Thank you for that! Where does The Dalai Lama\\'s Cat  The Dalai Lama\\'s Cat Guided Meditations rank among all the audiobooks youve listened to so far? Mesages are solid. However, the narration is atrocious and makes it very difficult to get through. Make sure to listen to a sample before purchasing. This was the most boring book I have ever read. The author\\'s descriptions are so tedious. Wow.. Upon reading the reviews of \\'The Push\\' by Ashley Audrain, I wasn\\'t sure what to expect. I went into it sort of blind and became addicted from the first chapter on. I finished it in two nights, listening voraciously.This is not a feel good book. Our protagonist suffers three major traumas, and each one of them by themselves is a mother\\'s worst nightmare. I was hooked, and like a bad accident on the side of the road I couldn\\'t look away.If you aren\\'t queasy and you can stomach extremely depressing and disturbing books, you may just like this. It was very well written and superbly narrated which gave it the creepy and devastating effect needed to portray the horrendous nature of the book. The accolade by Kristen Hannah was very well deserved.Highly recommend but heed the warnings.Wendi This work is a classic now expanded and updated to fit in todays current times. The book itself is worthy of five stars but the narration is perhaps the worst Ive ever experienced in my life. Extremely boring, slow, and monotonous. You will have to listen at least at least 1.3x Im only in the first chapter but already perturbed. The author is mispronouncing Conch so bad Im not sure I can continue. I know hes British but living in the Caribbean this is irritating. The narration is awful  nerve grating at the least, main character has no qualities that make her interesting, likeable, hated or anything at all she just generally seems pathetic. I forced myself to finish and the story has a little twist that made it interesting for 10 minutes. Too much description on every little thing would have rather had a more interesting story than hear how the moonlight reflects off this the Iphone sings like that ughh hard to keep track from one mc to the next. everyone they meet at the academy is really annoying and expects them to know things when obviously they don\\'t. it was really hard to follow and I kept getting really irritated over the unrealistic behavior. it\\'s obviously all fake but the whole relationship and conversation they had with everyone was laughable. couldn\\'t finish this book. The author builds the case that the mass incarceration of people is no mistake as the system has been made as the next evolution of the old Jim Crow laws in the south. She focuses on a broken war on drugs that have lead to a normalcy in the poor communities of everyone having a criminal back ground and how that background becomes a scarlet letter keeping them out of society and severely limiting their life choices. Getting through this audiobook was difficult when you are cringing every two sentences. I am appalled by the portrayal of both AfricanAmerican and the Caucasian characters in this book. It came across as caricatures and I am sad everyone is jumping on the bandwagon that the book was \\'amazing\\' when the dialogue of half these characters was so damn bad. This is pissing me off for anyone not of color picking up this audiobook and believing that this encompasses the black experience (how black people speak, especially when their backstories are those of college educated women (e.g. one character getting her second masters) so onedimensional and embarrassing. The book exhausted me with the terribly depressing story line of non stop abuse. The accidents on the job, the two car accidents, the blood, the total crazy family life was all too much. Please keep your sanity and pick another book. Where does Napoleon Hill\\'s Outwitting the Devil rank among all the audiobooks youve listened to so far? that psycho narcissist got away with murder. no doubt about it. a little slap on the hand and on she goes to do whatever horrible twisted tales she wants to. It makes my blood boil! she was no more an abused woman than I am. That in it\\'s self just boils my blood. There are real woman out there that are physically and mentally abused by their husband, and they have an up hill climb to get away from it! it\\'s narcissists like this beast that make it even harder for real woman to get help. I sincerely wish they would of locked her up for the rest of her miserable life! I picked this book up in an airport bookstore. You know how that goes. It\\'s slim pickings for anything other than a NYT Bestseller, Romance novel, or books on improving your golf swing. But unlike most lastminuteairport purchased books, I had it in my hands at every opportunity until I finished it. \\'Riveting\\' is the word. After you\\'ve read it, \\'haunting\\' is the word I\\'ve never entirely escaped it.This is the story of Christopher Johnson McCandless  a young man with tremendous Jack London and Hemingway ideals that wanders unprepared into the Alaskan wilderness. The rest of the book contains what otherwise might pass as filler  but isnt the stories of other young men, their idealism gone awry, who wander into the wilderness on journeys of self discovery and mad attempts to triumph over nature.Krakauer is qualified, too. He used to be one of these reckless, idealistic young men. He was a central participant in his infamous novel Into Thin Air. Ill never forget his recollection of solo freeclimbing (no safety ropes or partner) a very dangerous peak, thousands of feet in the air, with only his ice pick and crampons, feeling like his legs were going to go out from under him, and worrying that hed faint, because behind his back just out of sight, there was nothing except the great roaring of nothingness and a drop to the ground that no one would witness. Crazier? McCandless or the young Krakauer?What youre missing out on are the pictures of McCandless journeys. Make absolutely certain to get to a book store and at least flip through a copy. The cover photo sums up the reason why this book continues to haunt me. Its a picture of a snow covered, abandoned school bus  a bleak landscape, the middle of nowhere pines, a grey sky, no one in sight  that McCandless used as a shelter, stranded and struggling for survival in the wilds of Alaska. After waiting 20 years for the sequel I am very very disappointed and cant believe this got published. This was incredibly hard to listen to as well as follow at times. Im going to need for the author to explain why she went in this direction for such a highly anticipated sequel? This is not what fans have been waiting for. If you are expecting to go down a journey with Winter to see how life turns out for her after she is released from prison and if she still is the girl we love to hate or see if she grows up mentally THIS AINT IT! Where does The ONE Thing rank among all the audiobooks youve listened to so far? It made my head spin to hear Ms. Whitaker claim to be loving and non judgemental in one sentence and then spew hate towards all who don\\'t share her liberal platform. The few nuggets of wisdom I gleaned to help with my new sobriety were not worth the constant slander against my political views, or anyone with conservative political beliefs. This book should come with a warning label. It is a hate tirade against half of America with some sobriety tips. I don\\'t know why this happens, but lately every trilogy I read, the last book has been terrible disappointment. This one less than some and still it left me wondering wtf?!Characters were inconsistent, story wobbly and the ending blah. Oh well, Ill just stay away from trilogies from now on, but if you enjoyed the the first two books and must find out what the hell was the book of life, prepare for a mild, if not stronger disappointment. I was so mad at the main character I wanted to slap her.She was beyond week, stupid and nave.The first couple of hours are about a group of rich women that cheat on the husbands in bars and also have sex with teenagers.The main character has a ridiculous lesbian crush on an awful women, loosing her family in the process.She never gets a lawyer and lies poorly and continuously to the police.Im going to see if I can get my credit back for this terrible thing. I really loved The Martian. This didn\\'t even come close. It wasn\\'t terrible, but it just sort of sat there....I have a thing where I feel compelled to finish a book, even if I\\'m not enjoying it. I had to force myself to finish this one. i was recommended to read this by my Chinese girlfriend who shared that while it could be an exaggerated set of stories from one perspective, it was enriching nevertheless. i agree. A disappointment in every way. My instinct was to abandon the book after 15 minutes but I thought, its Jake Tapper, there has to me more here. But there is nothing. Atrocious writing, lame plotting, total absence of suspense. And Tapper gives the worst reading I have yet encountered. This is one where I really wish no stars was an option. This book is dreadful. Didn\\'t hold my interest at all...I am Alpharius. This is a lie. So disappointed in the audio signal it wasn\\'t clear at all. I\\'m so mad I really want to hear this book. But background noise is very disturbing. Ugh please fix this issue asap. Just realized hes a salesman yelling BE OBSESSED over and over again followed by AND BUY MORE OF MY WORTHLESS SHIT THAT I GOT TO SAY BECAUSE OF THE FAME I BOUGHT ON YOUTUBE ADS. Good grief! It got to the point that every time I heard it, my eyes bulged, my teeth clenched, and I wanted to smash my iPod. But I wanted to find out who did it, so I suffered... Little black book little black book little black book little black book... The characters have been battling their emotions and their pasts for several books now. Instead of progress past these issues they continue to get worse and these issues are brought up non stop. It annoying and makes for a very slow story. Im so sick of Kals dad. His is content to being a slave. His not going to be happy until Kal becomes a surgeon. Otherwise Kals just worthless to him.I was really looking forward to this book. Ive read some of the other reviews and like always their are those who give 5 star rating just because they like the author. They are just fanboys. This book just isnt as good as the other books in this series. Im not reading this book to learn about PTSD or schizophrenia. The author is getting lost in the details of his story and in doing so, is losing the thread of the story.I understand that Ill be among the few bad reviews for this book but Im use to Brandons other books were I dont want to set down the book until Im done. Im struggling to finish this book because all I want to do is just delete the book. I really did not like this book. the ending was disappointing. I like thrillers, but at times the book dragged and the characters were annoyingly dumb in their choices. in the end, the plot lacked believability. Ive owned this series of books for several years and as I started reading back through them I decided to get the audible version... it was a waste. I couldnt get past the first chapter because the narration was so bad. The overly thick accent of the narrator made it difficult enough, but when Saphiras voice was conveyed he made it sound like a troll! I couldnt listen any longer. Dragons are majestic, magical, and powerful in Paolinis world. The narrator made her sound brutish, unintelligent, and barely understandable. Absolutely horrible! Literally the worst narration Ive heard on audible in my many years and scores of titles. What disappointed you about Oathbringer? The quality of the recording is the absolute worst Ive ever heard on this platform. The edits are atrocious. Mistakes are left in, the sound quality goes up and down throughout, and noisy glitches abound. You should refund my credit this title and not sell it to anyone else until its cleaned up. I previously owned the book but this audio makes the book feel all new to me. It makes it feel like I am acually there with Percy as he is the nearly getting blasted by dodgeballs of death. It was defiantly woth my time. This book helped me understand things about me I didnt even know I didnt know. Every woman who has felt lost, confused or frustrated with how they have been treated, or how they find themselves reacting to certain situations should read this.Every man who says they want women to feel like they are equals should read this book.Maybe, just maybe, it could help to change the footing between men and women. Had to exchange it, slow, boring and couldnt keep my attention. Her books are hit or miss, I think this is a big miss. This book wasn\\'t bad but there is no way it should be scoring a 4 out of 5. This has helped to make me aware that we should not trust Audible reviews. What disappointed you about Yes Please? Would you listen to The Hidden Life of Trees again? Why? It had decent advice but I cant get over the narrators. Boring!!! You need to have some UMPH in your voice if youre going to read a empower book. I do not recommend Hands down the worst narrated book I\\'ve ever purchased from Audible. The narrator constantly mispronounces words. For example, she spells out \"SCIF\" instead of saying \"skiff.\" There is, last I checked, no \"r\" in \"Kiev.\"Just as bad, the text itself is full of minor errors. Dune is not set in the \"not too distant\" future. Sentences show up again, word for word, so often that I had to check whether the audio was skipping.Information security is an important subject and the author has a story worth telling, but the editing and narration are so bad they undermine the book. Not worth the listen. These book series makes no fucking sense what\\'s the point of the main character but I really want the author to tell me what\\'s the point of this book Book says you don\\'t know much I hate this book series I hate this book Ceres I want to alter To know which you created I hate it I dislike leaving a negative review of this book given the horrific events in Miller\\'s life but after slogging through 10 hours of it I am exhausted by how slow, vapid, and bland it is. Passages such as \"I sat on a bench. I took a photo of a burrito. I posted it online. I got 32 likes.\" Make me wonder just what I\\'m bothering with this for? How many sentiments can be broken into separate sentences all beginning with I? How many of the sentiments in the above passage serve to further the narrative or create an idea of Miller\\'s \\'personality?\\'And the narration. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stop allowing people to read the books they have authored. She is so slow and so monotone I could use this book as a sleep aid.I\\'m baffled by the positive reviews. I read a lot of memoirs so I know they aren\\'t as exciting as fiction but there is an art to characterization, to displaying feelings, to capturing moods, emotions, and settings and this book starts off with a few anecdotes but then devolves into the most tedious and mundane accounts of things I hesitate to refer to as events. As an avid reader I possess a good attention span. I\\'ve read War and Peace and Remembrance of Things Past, so I don\\'t need plot driven fiction to stay involved in a lengthy narrative.A ghostwriter or coauthor with some experience or an editor to pare this down from 15 hours to 4 might have helped to overcome the awful narration enough to make this a manageable book. As it is I can\\'t express how irritating and slow and uninteresting it is, one has to experience the tedium first hand to fully grasp that. I like some confrontation and angst in a story but this book was extremely hard to finish. So much could have been different if there was a conversation between trinity and Zane. Supposedly they have a cosmic connection through a bond that makes him her protector but they cant understand what the other is feeling or have an adult conversation. This goes on through so many chapters at the end that its just painful to read/listen to. Not entertaining at all just painful. I can\\'t wait to listen to the next one I like how all the characters are slowly progressing to what they will eventually become WTF. Lysander had the best voice and this new guy obviously didn\\'t even listen to the other books because he didn\\'t even attempt to pronounce the names of people or places correctly. The recast ed two characters in fact. Just pay them what they want. We sure pay enough for these books!!!!! I am very disappointed in Audible. Very disappointed indeed. It is very hard to listen to. Save your money and read the book. This was just pathetic. The plot is fairly basic. The writing style and dialogue are amateurish. Also, the narration is terrible. The wife\\'s southern drawl is overdone, the exwife sounds like a robot, and the daughter is melodramatic and overacts throughout the story. The content and the ideas of this book is great but the voice is boring and monotonous. I enjoyed the exercises, the examples, and thoughts behind the book but the narrator bad. I so wanted to enjoy this book as I\\'ve been watching lots of Bollywood romances during quarantine. The author got many elements right  the movie references, the food, the culture  but none of that saved the terrible, awful, eye rolling painful story. It reads like a first draft in desperate need of a strong willed editor. The title Marriage Game was a contrived rationale for the main characters to spend time together, but it got just ridiculously twisted as the novel limped along. The characters lurch around in a way that gives you emotional whiplash, and is all so extreme. The friend who is an ass has to be such an ass you can\\'t justify the friendship. The emotional overeating can\\'t just be an embarrassing moment of being sick, but she falls asleep on the floor next to the sick?? I was ok with the story for the first 7 hours, but the last 3 were just eye rolls and exhausted sighs desperate for it to be over. I wish I could just walk away without finishing because by the time we got to the end I\\'d lost all affection or respect for the characters. Where does Why Does He Do That? rank among all the audiobooks youve listened to so far? Where does Pussy rank among all the audiobooks youve listened to so far? I\\'ve listened to audio books since they were on cassette tapes, and this is the worst narration I\\'ve ever heard. If it hadn\\'t been an Alex Cross book, I\\'d have quit. I will not buy another one done by Brad Sanders. OMG, I\\'d return this but I\\'ve returned a couple of other books recently. I decided to slog through, but just looked down and, what? ...7 hours left and she\\'s about to have twins? Predictable and slow...Narrator sounds like she\\'s reading to a 3 yr old with inflections that are bout to drive me crazy. After reading both The Giver of Stars and The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek, (the latter of which was written first by Kim Michele Richardson) I am disappointed and troubled by the numerous remarkable similarities between these two books. Giver is also an oddly stark diversion in subject matter and setting for Jojo Moyes, and I have read and enjoyed all of Moyes previous books. I dont know what the explanation for this might be, but I found it disturbing and unfortunate. Where does Between Planets rank among all the audiobooks youve listened to so far? I want to finish The Wheel of Time. But this book made me want to take a break before I move on to the 6th book. The story mostly focuses on Nanheve and Elayne and what its going through their head, which 95 of the time was what they were wearing or what they dont want to wear. The book dragged on and on about nothing that moved the story forward the majority of the time. If this is how all the books from here on are going to be, I dont think I can finish these series. I respect those Robert Jordan fans who love the story. But this book was an awful lot of nothing to do with the main plot line. Terrible. First the narration for this book is bad so that for sure didn\\'t help but I am writing this review understand that it is a set up book which tends to be more slow and boring. With that said though this is incredibly boring. I don\\'t think this author was really a fan of Star Wars or know the smaller details of this era because there is a ton of interesting stuff to play with even if you want new characters, settings, and locations but it feels as though this author only know about the tip of the iceberg. I also found some of the new characters annoying but that\\'s preference so ill let that go.I do have hopes for this series because it wasn\\'t terrible but it wasn\\'t a strong start. Between the southern drawl in the baby talk I couldn\\'t even get past one chapter of this audiobook. I may try to buy the book later and see how it fares to read it but definitely not able to deal with the narrator on this book. This book was awful. Who can relate to these characters?! Even the children where terrible...narration, I suppose she worked with what she had to read.I want my 12 hours back! Life is short and dont waste your time. Ill be returning this book! If you\\'re planning on buying this book, I suggest you buy Bad Ass (yellow) or Bad Ass at Making Money (green). Jen is a master storyteller. Her books are fun and funny. This one just didn\\'t have me laughing or feeling like I was having ahah moments repeatedly. I gave it four stars for the story. Her other books I give a big five stars. After a year of using and doing the techniques given by the author, I am 50 lbs down and still going and keeping the weight off. What disappointed you about Iron Gold? the performance was horrible, as well as the storyline. This is the first book that I didn\\'t even want to finish. This book is horribly recorded. Some parts are actual speeches and the audio is so poor, you can\\'t tell what Ruth is saying. This was a first for me in all the books I\\'ve gotten from Audible. I always listen to the sample before I buy an audiobook so I know if I\\'ll like the reader. I did that with this one as well, but apparently I didn\\'t get to the parts where the characters were having a conversation. I gave this book about 2 hours before I had to stop listening. The narrator\\'s voice was fine and normal when she was just reading through the story, but as soon as there was dialogue, she would become very (VERY) annoyingly nasally. This was particularly bad when the character named Julie was speaking. It was like the reader was channeling some incredibly horrible sounding young, whiny teenage girl for the intonation. It was awful. I would highly recommend listening to the sample and seeing if there are any parts in it that have conversation between the characters before buying this audible. I will definitely be taking note of this narrator and staying away from her from now on. I will also be reading the book myself instead since I\\'m still interested. As a Green Beret who has worked closely with CCTs I had VERY high hopes for this book  but... The author seemed intent on proving how badass CCTs were rather than focusing on Chapman and his story. I do like how he pulled no punches on the BS the other players pulled  but again  it just seemed like he had an personal agenda other than to tell Chapman\\'s story.Narrator was really bad  had me rolling my eyes several times. I cant believe this was recently remastered. The Narrator taking a deep breath with each sentence was seriously making me feel claustrophobic. It was weird my own breathing felt off while listening. Maybe Im really sensitive to it.Horrible. I own nearly 100 audible books and this was the worst ever!!! Where does Rush rank among all the audiobooks youve listened to so far? I hate to do this, but Im going to drop this series as Ive grown tired of the similar or parallel plots to previous installments. In addition, the frequency of victimized women and/or their circumstances similar to Eves past has become tedious. Dont get me wrong, I applaud Eves resolute determination to make something of herself despite her tragic beginnings. However, I\\'m tired of almost every victim reminding Eve of herself and that room in Dallas, TX.I\\'ve stuck with this series for this long because I love how the supporting cast is well fleshed out. Unfortunately, the increasing transparency of social commentary cancels out any \"escapism\" in fiction. For the first time, I ended up returning this title and exchanging it for something else. Too long, somewhat repetitive, terrible audio editing. But, the core content is worthy. Buy this one in print...skip the audio. This is a wasted hour of my life I will never get back. Don\\'t waste your money. he is trying to make this \"the Bible\" in the intro and it\\'s just disgusting. The Narrator should try a little harder. Modestly not rememberble 2.5 stars overall. chilly time Didnt realize this was 8 min long and cost 16!! Not worth it bad value Where does Psychosis vs. Psychopathy rank among all the audiobooks youve listened to so far? This audio is a very odd experience. Very little language learning and didn\\'t entice me at all to buy any of their products. Not recommended. Just 10 minutes ads. Dont buy it. Waste of time ever !!!!!!! Not worth it at all the first 10 minutes is a sales pitch by the time i got to the lesson i was annoyed and found the arabic very difficult to decypher It is just a commercial for their website. Dont bother with it. Totally useless for actually learning french. Hard to listen to. Predictable turns of phrases and stereotypical interactions between mother and teenaged daughter. Painful, actually. Maybe it got better after the first chapter, but I didn\\'t listen. I liked the information being read to me, but it was so basic with no character made it kinda boring to listen to. But over all I did get the information needed sooner than me reading it till the end myself . I would have stopped reading by chapter 3 . This is just an ad for the books that are NOT FREE. This is extremely misleading. DO NOT BOTHER BUYING This book us horrible. It belong in garbage! what a wast of my time. The information was stright frim the internet Where does What is Knowledge? rank among all the audiobooks youve listened to so far? You only listen to the book your kindergartener can not follow along with the audio! No pics no words therefore it sucks! Reader is boring and just bad, Very bad. Read there real book. Pass on this one. So, sooooo disappointed. Literally talks about astrology half the book, but doesnt mention it in description at all... wasted time I did not enjoy the person\\'s voice, deep breaths, and sighs throughout the audio. Sorry! The information isn\\'t bad. the way its written and read makes it very hard to listen to while staying focused. I found my mind getting bored and wandering almost instantly every time. Extremely well written.., I heard no \" mispronounciations\" like the other reviewer complained. I enjoyed the not overly descriptive writing , the character development, and that air of menace. I\\'d rather have a little predictability than plot twists that are far fetched and silly. No the end is not a huge shocker for jaded thriller fans but the slow build up is an entertaining but sad journey.'"

       "' Thank you for being obedient and sharing your story  I laughed I cried and felt lifted I had all the feels  A must read for all  Complete in one sitting  I enjoyed this book and its predeessor  They both have good atmosphere  okay plot and decent pacing  They also both paint a dark and cynical view of society  I liked the reader on this book as well   Best in the series so far  Thanks for making sure this one didnt have the production errors the previous two installments had  Also love Kristens way to revisit old favorites friends  This such a great series   Fortune is always getting into some kind of trouble its great   If you havent listened to this series I would suggest at least listening to book one  This can be listened to as a standalone but if you really want to enjoy it do yourself a favor and listen to the entire series  The antics  sarcasm and humor make this a great fun murder mystery that I was sorry to see come to an end Cassandra Campbell does a superb job narrating This book has my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank You  I ve purchased and read every book Malcolm Gladwell has ever released  I d probably rate all of them five stars This is basically a version of one of his Revisionist History podcast stories  I felt like I was just listening to the podcast  Yes there was more information in the book but not enough to justify purchasing the book  Listen to the podcast  It s free and damn near the same exact thing  This was the most satisfying audiobook experience Ive ever had  It was immersive and sincere  I felt as if I was sitting around a family room with Seth Rogen and cast inperson  The production quality is terrific  Most importantly though  it was heartwarming to hear someone with a big heart share zesty wisdom on life  Very informative and made me aware of how certain groups misuse data or cherry pick to push an agenda  People are smart enough to make up their own mind when given all the facts  Nora Roberts  my favorite author always delivers  Legacy has it all  a great story that blends family and friends with suspense and emotion  I laughed and I cried and was sorry to see the book come to an end  I always look forward to Noras next book and wish I could write as eloquently  So grateful that the powers that be listened and rereleased this  Sooo much better and now we can actually hear what Nicole is trying to teach     I am not necessarily fanatical about this actor  but I can say now with conviction I am fanatical about this author  I found Matthew so honest  witty  intelligent  articulate  compassionate  brave  loyal  etc  His impersonation skills are spot on  I listened to all 6 hours in one day  from my not feeling well bed    so entertaining  In my opinion  Matthew McConaughey is an incredible role model for a human being  Thank you Matthew  What is fascinating about this collaboration with Dr  Perry and Ms  Oprah Winfrey is the clarity it brings to so many personal questions  The title speaks volumes about the authors intentions and the books purpose  When we walk through fires of trauma  neglect  abandonment   and discontent  we are more empathetic  We judge less and love more  We work diligently to protect those we love The format was a combination of science  art  and reality  Personally  I find the book quite stimulating  I will listen to it again on audible and review the file with the description of the brain Dr  Perrys explanations about the brains response to trauma is extremely insightful  Oprahs questions and explanations will help readers truly understand what happened to them Having followed Oprahs career since 1987  I am so happy she reconciled her relationship with her mother  Its amazing how connected we all are by our life experiences  Keep Rising Stronger Dr  Pauline E  Wallner  author of the Rising Stronger Series I don t underetand all the high ratings for this one  The narrator did an excellent job  but the story was preposterous  There were too many plot holes  unexplained threads  and convenient revelations that seemed forced on the listener rather than developing organically  I m a huge Nora Roberts fan  and I loved this book  It s right up there at the top of my list of NR favorites  I found the subject of the Missoula Smokejumpers   Zulies   fascinating and the story was filled with interesting and realistic characters  Roberts did a great job of mixing mystery and romance into the unique and dangerous world of the smokejumpers Rowan Tripp is a strong  independent female character  and if her or any of her fellow smokejumpers  language gets a bit colorful at times  as some readers have objected to   it s only when appropriate to the story and  well  they re smokejumpers  not librarians Rebecca Rowan is excellent as narrator  and listening to her is part of the reason I enjoyed the book so much  I wasn t sure how I d like a woman doing so many male voices  but it was no problem  I hope she does more of Nora Roberts  books in the future  I grew up reading Asimov in the golden age of SF  I am writing this because there were no reviews for this brand new book  I am mowing my lawn listening to it and feel compelled to encourage people who love the science in SF to give this book a chance  I enjoyed both versions of the Martian  film and book   Dont let paucity of reviews scare you this has been  so far  a compelling book  Remember when all good series were trilogies  I bet you are glad this one is going to be more than just 3 books then Rewaarrd A sense of emptiness and anticipation until the next book is released     I couldn t finish this  you don t learn anything new  I found that at best  its a reminder on what to always keep in mind  But its all common sense things anyone with a little bit of empathy a desire to communicate  connect and be heard already knows  If you find yourself struggling  its a good listen  to remind you of how to be you  and how to be good for the world and how to be someone who can take in the good  I ve listened to this book twice  now  it being the first in my library to get a second complete relisten   and the stars I gave it a year and a half ago still stand  My thoughts  though  have matured a little  Harari covers mostly social aspects of the human species all the way from our cradle in Africa 200 000 years ago  up till 2014 I am not learned in the field  and cannot immediately say anything about the accuracy of what Harari writes  and I note several more or less expert reviewers giving Harari flack for sensationalism and errors  As such  perhaps it is good not to take Sapiens as gospel as far as details go In a course I followed as part of my PhD in physics  we touched upon how the need for accurate time keeping came about  where my professor suggested the need arose not too long after the black death when scarcity of labour made it more important for skilled craftsmen to keep tabs on how long they actually worked on a given project  Harari suggests accurate time keeping came about in the newly railroaded Great Britain  where accurate scheduling suddenly became important  To be fair  Harari really discusses synchronisation  not accuracy  but the gist of the argument makes it seem like the need for train time tables gave rise to the industry of accurate time pieces  Whether the black death or the trains were more critical  I can t say  but the Swiss began making their famous watches in the 15th century  which is a bit more in line with the black death than with the industrial revolution Be that as it may  a potential lack of exact facts seem to me not to detract from a slew of very interesting thoughts on the broader topic Three points stick with me1  The fraud of agriculture I feel Harari paints an unduly romantic picture of the life of a hunter gatherer  saying they had 40 hour work weeks and spent lots of time with their children and telling stories under the stars  It sounds a bit stylised  But  my gut tells me he is on the right track in his condemnation of the agricultural revolution  As humans  we have an incredible inability to look ahead  and Sapiens posits this inability trapped us in a dreadful spiral of growing population and diminishing freedom  At first  it seems like a good idea to spend an extra month in this here spot to tend to some plants that grew really well last year  Take a month and weed a bit  maybe chase off a herd of grazers or whatever  and then continue on the nomad trek  Next year  you will return to loads of tasty fruits grains some plant or other  Well  a month turns to two  then the band of foragers suddenly have a couple babies on their hands  and might not easily move for another few months  Now you need a hut  rather than just a leanto  Before your grumpy grandfather knows it  you re established  and you re farming more than you forage and hunt  And your great grandchildren are two fields over clubbing another farmer to death to take his land  And women are suddenly just baby machines rather than root and berry pickers  And one third of your children die of starvation and diseases from closequarters living  Oh  and you are about as likely to die of violence as of starvation  Great The story Harai weaves simply makes sense to me  We see it time and again we start doing something that seems great in the moment  but three generations hence  we ve no more oil  the atmosphere is turning toxic  and we re hopped up on a cocktail of hormone mimicking chemicals  And the goddam bees are dying  So  for all of Harari s romanticising of hunter gatherer societies  I think he s onto something about how we accidentally fell into becoming farmers  paving the way for slums  kings  and feudal hierarchy 2  How come European culture became so dominant This is an interesting topic that can easily turn into a trashy cultural masturbation contest  but on the whole  I feel Harari navigates it well  Now  I am of both Southern and Northern European descent  so I may just not be sufficiently tuned to pick up on major issues with his arguments  That said  he makes the case that in the 15th century  there were no major technological differences between the largest powers in the world Europeans  the Ottomans  the Chinese  they were all pretty evenly matched as far as technology went  and it might seem like a surprise that only 200 300 years later  Europe would have such a choke hold around the globe  Harari s suggestion for the key difference is social and philosophical Europeans were unusually willing to accept ignorance  and unusually interested in filling these gaps in knowledge  European cultures were the first ones in which great swathes of individuals had personal interest in discovering stuff  Of course  in light of our global culture where these kinds of ideals are  well  ideals  this sounds uncomfortably like European cultures are  better   But that isn t what Harari drives at  It simply  is  like this  Meaning also that incredible damage and suffering  past and future  is at the hands of European cultures  Speaking of how things might have been better if some other culture had gained the upper hand the way Europe did is not part of Harari s discussion  but that s fine by me he is describing history at this point  letting the listener draw any moral conclusions on their own 3  Empire  Capitalism  ScienceAs a budding scientist with what I consider pure motivations  I m no great fan of how science and imperialism has gone hand in hand since the scientific revolution  Yet  here we are  Harari draws a parallel between science and empire building in which he posits a philosophical equivalence science is about dominion over nature  insofar as large amounts of science is done to bolster our ability to make use of nature for our purposes  And the parts of science not about conquest as such  are still all about us  and our desire to pad the list of things we understand  Perhaps it could not really be otherwise  or  perhaps  it is a consequence of European hegemony  and another culture s approach might have led to science unmarred by ties to economic gains and imperial ambitions Some critics from the fields of anthropology and history say Harari lacks originality here  and says he goes a bit rogue in the parts where he provides his own thoughts  This is pretty scathing critique  but also a bit beside the point  I don t think Sapiens is entirely accurate  and I don t think it was meant to be used as the curriculum for a human history course  I think it lays out some sensible arguments about human history that I would not have seen were it not for Harari writing this book  and that is what I expect from a popular science work  I now have a little insight into a field that interests me  and have things to think about Well worth a listen  Meticulous research  funneled through the heart of a poet for me  this is about as good as it gets  Add to that Mr  Urrea s farsuperior pronunciation of words and names in Spanish  and this is the best audiobook I ve read in years  If you like horror  true crime or literary nonfiction  how many titles can you say that about   get this one TODAY  I m using all my credits on Urrea books until I read them all  and I m buying print copies as well  Introverts and logical people would find this book useful  Each chapter provides examples   before  and  after  dialogs  and a list of actions  which research has demonstrated to be effective   After finishing each chapter  practice the techniques before moving on  While some of the suggestions are simple  like having hand gestures to make your talk more engaging to the listener   you need to develop that habit and be able to do it naturally  Or you can sign up for the digital bonus material at scienceofpeople com toolbox There are some chapters that highlight concepts from other authors  such as Paul Ekman  Emotions Revealed  and Gary Chapman  The 5 Love Languages   If you ve already read these books  the material is redundant  There are also snippets of repeated information or research from  Predicably Irrational  by Dan Ariely and  Influence  by Robert Cialdini  I have always liked K L Slater  had high expectation for this one I am kind of disappointed  this one is different from her other novels  not as exciting Lucy PriceLewis  as always  performed exceptionally  amazing narration  OMG   I actually clapped my hands while driving the car  alone  mind you  when the reader spoke the last words of this amazing audiobook  I LOVE the movie  but Miyazaki s version is so far removed from Jones  original novel  I was astonished  I enjoyed every second listening to cantankerous Sopie and vain Howl and manic Calcifer  Oh  how I want a Calcifer of my own  A wonderful  wonderful story for kids and adults  How could I have never heard this story about the Osage Indian Tribe before  I am wellread and curious  but it is a history that while not covered up  is little known  I am so glad I read this book  I am telling all my friends to read this book for the history  none of them knew this story either I picked it up as I wanted to know more about how the FBI was created  What I got was a riveting murder mystery  my favorite genre   excellent history that includes oil  homesteading  tribal history and how the FBI was created Some are complaining about the narration  I am fine with the narration  My complaint is that the story feels like it came to a halt when it changed to the first person in the final act  That portion of the book should have been interwoven throughout the book as it slowed down the momentum of a great middle section of the book  I cant really describe in words what this book means to me  As a first generation Korean American  Michelle Zauners memoir is more than her life and losing her mom at an early age  Crying in H Mart is a sentiment to all first generation Korean American raised in America  We are neither Koreans or Americans because our birth place is different from our ethnicity  but yet we have two cultures to deal with all the time  Its really difficult to explain if you were raised with one language in the household  Many first generations are multilingual and we need to switch one language to the other as we communicate with our familys native language  A lot of times  we are confused about how to identify ourselves because our Korean is nowhere near perfect from our parents Im really glad that the author narrates her own book because her Korean dialogue is so comforting to listen to because that is how we speak at family gatherings when there is a variety of cultures in the house  My Korean relatives say that me and my brothers sound more American even though we are speaking in broken Korean  But yet our parents label us as being American first because we were born and raised in the States I first learned about Michelle Zauner when she did an interview on The Sporkful podcast  I was instantly hooked when she described what its like to be shopping at H Mart and see all of the foods that her mom made for her  Fortunately  my parents are still with us and as they get older  I cherish my moms cooking more each time I ask her to make me kimchi jjigae  Other than my grandma who has long passed away  my eomma is the only person who knows how spicy to make the strew  There is nothing like having my moms kimchi I cannot recommend this book enough  especially if you are Korean American  I really hope that this book gets translated into hangug because I will be buying a copy for my parents because it will explain a lot to them on what its like being Korean American  I was afraid to read this book bc some of the reviews were so SCATHING  Im so glad I clicked anyways  I was swept into a world that interested me one that felt familiar and foreign at the same time  If you are someone who has struggled with the shame of hiding parts of yourself from repeated trauma and or neglect  or just plain old fear   then this MAY be the book for you  It may have a special meaning for your heart that tends to be lost on other folks  Not everything we hide is darkness  boy did I need that reminder  I wonder if some of what irks people about this book is a general ignorance of just how hard it is to come from a difficult childhood  the main character is an impoverished orphan forced to hide her powers  and find a way of belonging without sacrificing those abused parts of you all over again Over the years I have found that people will pick at anything that is hopeful  charming  cheesey  and mythical bc they are too fraught with their entitled sense of what art is to love common  beautiful things  Has the love triangle been done before  Yes  Is the Darkling a sexier  younger version of Snape combined with Edward Cullen  Also yes  This book was NOT Dostoyevsky by any stretch of the imagination but who the hell cares  Im glad it wasnt  Frankly  I don t want to read something obtuse in the age of 2020 2021  Im glad it was narrated by a woman who sounded a little corny at times  I thought her villainous voice was perfectly executed  People hate on the main character s whiney codependant tenancies bc they ve either a   never been broken enough to become that dependent themselves or b   been too proud to witness that kind of weakness in their own lives FINALLY  I am Russian and I did not find this to be cultural misappropriation at all  I actually felt honored that someone would set a story in the barren terrain of my ancestors  Story One of the best additions to the series  Every book gives us a little look into each characters background and we finally get to know a little more about Blue  This series always brings out the emotions for me happy  sad  excited  nervous  angry  passionate    the list goes on  Thats how you know youve found a truly talented author when they can completely immerse you into their universe  This time around we also learned more about the shifters way of life and how much keystone has grown as a team  In the beginning they worked together great but they have come such a long way and now work as a true unit  Were at book 10 and I cant wait for the next one  Usually at this point a series can sometimes lag but in this case it just gets better and better Audio Nicole Poole kicked it out of the park yet again  Shes an amazing narrator and her voice acting ability really brings the story to life  Five star

person happy about doing the thing you suggest Thanks Ralph No one loved Jack Reacher more than I did  at least for the first 6 or 7 installments  The plots were taut and unexpected  our hero intriguing and the wit as dry as the Mojave  But these wonderful books have devolved into selfparody  This novel has a ridiculous plot  with such risible features as an inflight brawl in an airplane restroom  As if two small people could fit in one of those  much less the Frigidairesized Reacher and his opponent  Also  Reacher has theories about himself that involve campfires and howling wolves and he s happy to share them  The mystery of Reacher s stunning fitness  the man eats pancakes and cheeseburgers exclusively  logs countless hours riding around in cars and never so much as skims a gym contract  is explained  basically  as  born this way   I am very very sorry to be unable to recommend this book  I enjoyed this book  I always enjoy Sebastian Junger s books  I recommend it as a short introspective work about a mode of travel unheard of these days  In some regards it is a Huckleberry Finn adventure by and for grownups  I am 53  and now I feel like making a similar journey  That is one of the main points of the book there is something inherently appealing to the itinerant tribal type life depicted in this book  In that regard  this book ties in nicely with Junger s last book  Tribe  I totally get how this lifestyle can feel so rewarding One thing I love about Junger s work is that he frequently digresses from his narrative to interject a brief  well researched treatise that supports the current topic  He offers some intriguing examples of history  physics  biology  religion  etc  to deepen your understanding of the people or situation he describes in his story  It makes his books that much more involving  He does this better than any other author I have read  and this book is no exception This book pulled me in and maintained my interest  However  it left me with the feeling that it was only the middle of a more interesting  longer book  Junger is deliberately vague about the purpose and origin of his adventure  and uncommonly never even mentions the name of any of his companions  The book starts with the journey well underway  and ends abruptly  As a literary style  it is intriguing  but leaves me preoccupied with what was not told  I am intensely curious about it Junger s narration can be jarring at first  He is not a slick sounding actor  He is better  I have come to appreciate him as I do with most nonfiction authors who read their own books  nobody else knows exactly what to emphasize  or can relate another person s speech and mannerisms as well as the author  In his book  War  he relates the soldiers  dialog as if they were speaking  I have never felt closer to the subjects of a book  War is one of my all time favorite audiobooks  and Freedom earns my continued loyalty Junger has in me  a lifelong fan  An incredible history book in general  If you re looking for a comprehensive history of the Viking this is the book you re looking for  I had written out a lengthier review which didn t get recorded for some reason after I saved it  The Great History lecture series on the Vikings is good for sure but this book goes more in depth than that series And because christopher doty s review in Audible doesn t clarify what exactly he means by  rewriting history in order to make it fit into their politixal ideals   I can say anyone that finds this book  too political  would be the type of person that finds Mr  Rogers too political   Ignoring the fact the book literally talks about  Viking Politics  for a moment   I ll go ahead and assume he was talking about Viking sexuality which the author talks about at length  He does mention that the Sagas and Norse mythology says that Odin has sex with both men and women  The author also mentions what would be called in modern times  transgender  burials discovered of men wearing women s clothing and women dressed in battle regalia  He says the Vikings might have had different concepts of gender  as our own culture does for nonbinary  trans  etc  but that we shouldn t just assume they only had male and female  That was the point he was making in that section of the book  A SHOCKING statement to make for an archaeologist  don t forget to separate our own cultural views from those of the past   He also mentions that in Viking culture there were people that could shapeshift into wolves  bears  and ravens  So for his broader point we can t know exactly what all they thought about the genders of such beings and the people in general unless they wrote it down  The author substantiates all of his claims with written documents and known discoveries throughout and states points he s making that are unknown but speculated  This book is amazing and you ll love it if you re interested in general history or the Vikings  I have always admired the Vuolo family since they were married in the public eye  You never really get to know someone  but this wonderful book helps shape  in my mind  who they are as people and Christ followers  Such a great story and look into their past  So very inspiring with the direction always pointing to the hope they hold in Christ Jesus  Uplifting  real  and motivational  Thank you for this awesome book  I found this book to be extremely well documented and quite frankly  without the exceptional narration I dont feel I would have gained as much from the authors knowledge in trauma  If youre a fan of Sam Harris youll love this narration  As to the content  as someone who is a survivor of childhood trauma  I felt the book lingered too long in the multiple case histories and why of the traumas and missed an opportunity to provide actionable solution  tools and resources for the reader  If youre a trauma survivor the last thing you want or need is 20 hours of dark and triggering accounts  youre living your own trauma already  What would have been invaluable to me would have been a sense of hope and possibility for healing and again  tools and resources to help those of us highly functional but quietly suffering  a chance to take what this obviously brilliant clinician has to share and incorporate it into our own lives  Still well worth the investment  Wow  This is by far the best audiobook Ive ever heard  and one of the best books Ive ever read  It made me laugh  It made me cry  It made me think  Trevor brings such a unique world view  and even though his life was so much different than mine  there was still so much I could relate to  I learned so much listening to this  about apartheid  race  poverty  and the power of language Excellently performed  obviously  It feels less like a book and more like Trevor is just telling his story  I listened to the outhouse blind grandma chapter while I was at the gym and I literally had to stop working out for a couple minutes because I was laughing so hard This is the gold standard of audiobooks  Its 100 worth a listen  and a relisten  So good  I adored this unforgettable story of a daredevil female aviator  The characters and the writing were amazing  Marian Graves was the fictional female pilot who disappeared in 1950 while attempting an unprecedented northsouth circumnavigation of the earth  On the final leg  she vanished in the South Pacific  Earhartstyle Sixty years later  Hollywood casts a troubled starlet  Hadley Baxter  in a film that centers on Marians disappearance My criticism of the book is the Hadley Hollywood story  The book was fantastic without it  and I felt it detracted from the storys greatness  Fortunately  that part was minimal in the 25 hour audiobook  Cassandra Campbells excellent narration made up for the Hadley portion  I will definitely listen to this again  Most adults I know  just about all of them in fact  hit a point in life where they shifted focus from seeking approval and acceptance to developing inner validation to pursue their own needs and priorities  Yet somehow Doyle s journey to selfacceptance is somehow novel  It truly isn t  except for the amazing amount of time she spends blaming society  family  friends  coworkers  but mostly society  for forcing her to conform into a life she never wanted  The tone is sad and helpless  despite her apparent  triumph  today  Her observations are mistdeep  for example reading the different promotional messages on the shampoo soap bottles of her son and daughter and acting as if SHE alone unlocked the matrix to how advertising reflects and reinforces conventional social and sexual norms  Most of the book goes on like this  youngadult epiphanies made by a 40ish woman  burdened by smallminded pastors  neighbors  coworkers  and on and on  Her anecdotes are trivial drama that unfold as if the listener is supposed to be aghast at the indignities she suffers  The bad  coercive and toxic forces poisoning her are readily identified by their behavior  and we are to sit back and sympathize with our brave and burdened heroine  There is nothing new in these experiences  it s called life  we all go through it  we all wade in the muck  and figuring it all out is part of the plan  Again  adulthood  I wish Ms  Doyle no ill will  and if she is happy in her new life than good for her  But this is exhaustive navelgazing at its worst  an inward  solipsistic journey with no real destination other than her shrill discard of her previous self  It makes me a bit sad to know that thousands of readers will lap this up and rave about its  life changing   effect  I don t think we should encourage  let alone praise  what is nothing more than very articulate whining  It s just a bad look  and hardly inspiring  There are volumes of available titles that do a far better job of chronicling this type of personal journey with true dignity  grace  and universal insights that define strength of character  These voices offer more reflection  less accusation  and true inward validation that doesn t need to point fingers of blame  But nothing I say here will influence those that will find their own voice in hers  in all its  still  biting tone  And that s a real shame  So I guess I ll just close by saying welcome to adulthood Ms  Doyle  better late than never  The story is interesting and the voice actor is good  but there is just one level of emotion throughout all the hours of this book  Perhaps if Id read it rather than listening to it Id have enjoyed it more  I kept finding myself rolling my eyes because I felt like was listening to a melodramatic teen who feels everything excessively intensely  Who can keep that up for 300 years  I also didnt like the prose style multiple similes for what seemed like everything  I think a more thorough editing and a firmer director activeIy looking for interpretations that would allow for variation in the emotional tone would have made a better experience for me  I liked the ending  I went through a whole range of emotions with this book  It s been a long time since I ve cried  laughed cheered  and fell in love with a character in a book  I m gonna miss you  I didn t want this to end  I m really enjoying the book and content but disappointed that the PDF supplement mentioned by Dr  Leaf isn t available  Beware that once again Audible has not made the promised content that you re paying for available  Keep in mind before you decide to purchase    This is the best mediation manual I ve read  and I ve been through a lot  It gives a nod to tradition but also dives deep into the psychological transformation that happens during meditation and explains the phenomenon that you will experience  it also gives very detailed and explicit instructions for each stage and warns about some traps that exist I found in stage 5 a trap that my father had been in for decades  and is now moving past  It s a great read and even better listen since the narrator makes you feel like he s instructing you directly The glossary and index make it a great reference manual  so I purchased both printed and audio book  I can t wait to meet and speak to Culadasa  interestingly enough he trained with the same teacher I did when I was a kid  Kama Ananda  I can t tell you how many idiotic reviewers have tricked me into listening to terrible books here  Now I m NOT saying that most reviewers on audible are halfbaked idiots who would be fascinated with a bug zapper  I m NOT saying that if you ve written a review on this site  there s a 90 chance you have brain damage  And I m definitely NOT saying that most reviewers of scifi or fantasy never mentally progressed from their teen years  Oh and finally I m 100 NOT saying that most reviewers are  in their personal lives  trash people with less potential than a microwaved hamster  My point take this with a grain of salt  peasant Ok  Deep breath    DUNGEON CRAWLER CARL IS THE BEST AUDIO BOOK I VE LISTENED TO IN YEARS    DCC is an incredible mix of humor  action  scifi  and fantasy that absolutely overflows with personality  thanks in no small part to the talented Jeff Hays  How tf does he do all those voices  I was certain there were at least 3 voice actors  Brafreakinvo  my man It was an outright pleasure to follow Carl and her royal majesty  Princess Donut  on their crawl  again   Their relationship development is believable and engaging  Never thought I d say that about a man and his ex girlfriend s cat  but here we are  The magic system ai is fun as hell  enemies are generally described with stomach churning  and hilarious  detail  and MOST fights are seatofyourboxerscan tgotosleepuntilIknowwhathappens crazy  excluding grind sessions  But those are fun too Not going to get into details because YOU should download and start listening right now with a fresh head and no expectations other than a great time  Don t read any other reviews  This is it  God is speaking to you through my fingers  That s right  this is God  I know about the weird sh t you ve been watching on p rnhub and we ll talk about it when you get up here  Ok  gotta run  I m meeting Satan for brunch and she is suuuuch a drama queen when I m late  Thank you for this book  I thank the author narrators and all who braved letting things come to light  I am conflicted about this much needed agency or service  It has the capacity to much good and much harm  And it has done both  Thank you for risking it all to try to protect our priceless symbol of power and freedom  We elect them and you try to protect them  Its a revelation to me how much JFKs tragedy is central to the services outlook  Likewise 911 These kinds of events are very much living under your skin  Thank you for dedicating yourselves to preventing these kinds of events  However the patient  the service  may be in extremis  How can a regular person assist you  How can I trust you not to push such a racist and mysogynistic outlook  I remind myself you are just human beings  But you have a higher calling to place yourself between I can campaign to my president and congress to provide a better budget but I need some assurance from you cops that you are not going to make me regret it  Better equipment and more money and efficiency should come with changes to the boys club outlook  I am also human  This is an amazing and very helpful book  First  I love that it is like a conversation  Second  the constant is great  I didnt learn this stuff growing up and so it is great to learn now  I highly recommend this book   I m so pleased that this author decided to write a trilogy that actually had a satisfactory ending  This is a great example that a series doesn t have to be over 10 books long to be an engaging  fun  thoughtful story that takes the reader through a powerful arc  Absolutely recommended  I spent most of the time yelling at the main characters for being irrational brats  Even the villain made more sense  Mal yelled at everyone for no reason  I think he needed a hug  This book was thoroughly disappointing  The main characters where completely unlikable The villain is one of the most likable characters in the series   I was actively rooting for him  This book is about developing a factbased world view  Most people think the world is in the same state as they remembered it decades ago  Africa is filled with people in extreme poverty  the population is increasing exponentially  and most women in the world don t receive an education  In fact  most of the population is in the middle and the birth rate has decreased dramatically in many countries Ten reasons why we get it wrong1  Gap  categorizing by extremes  such as rich and poor 2  Negativity  things are getting worse 3  Straight Line  think the line on a chart will continue into the future at that same angle 4  Fear5  Size  misjudging the size of things due to lack of reference 6  Generalization7  Destiny  think people don t change 8  Single  a problem has a single cause 9  Blame10  Urgency  jump to action without knowing all the facts  First  like most marketing books  this one spends a majority of its time on marketing itself to me  Dude  I have already bought the book  Im reading it right now  You can stop advertising  Just give me the content Second  I was mildly surprised how the author doesnt apply his own principles in that marketing  The books method is the hero  praised over and over in a tone deaf way  Shouldnt  according to the books principles  I  the customer be the hero Third  none of the actual content seems original and is just basic marketing know how presented in a new annoyingly unoriginal storyline  yoda and luke skywalker  barf what a waste of time and money  My library includes some 700 books  many about similar topics  This book is near the top  The central message of this book is that you must control your internal monologue to be effective in interpersonal interactions  The book had just the right amount of scientific data to keep a scientist interested  and just enough animated discussion to make it a delightful page turner I have been working on my internal monologue for many years  so this book came a bit late for me  But for those who suffer from brain ANTS  automatic negative thoughts   I recommend first that you read Feel The Fear and Do it Anyway  then this book and you will be much more effective in your daily life  I sat down with the actual book and read it  I wanted my husband to  know  about it and he doesn t make time to read  This story  based on the Old Testament couple  Hosea and Gomer  is brought into the 19th century during the Gold Rush era in California  Many times during the reading  I m crying openly and talking to God  I found myself being changed with a permanent awareness of the Love of a heavenly Father that I never knew  This book starts slow but when it builds moves like a runaway train  After it s finished  you continue to think about these people as if they are really someone that you know  I can qualify this as the best  most transforming book I ve ever read unequivicably  I strongly suggest this  J D  Vance tells his story of his rise from a poor family in Appalachia  He goes on to serve in the Marines  and completes college and Yale Law School  This is mostly a personal story of his family which is both dysfunctional and beloved  It is an intelligent look at life in rural Kentucky and Ohio  In addition  he talks about studies of entrenched rural poverty  and what government can and cannot do  He quotes research and his own life equally  The author goes beyond the stereotypes of hicks and rednecks  and gives us an honest portrait of hillbilly life  for good and bad  I enjoyed this and learned a lot  My wife beat me to the punch with the line Id intended to start my reflections on this The Alchemist is this generations Jonathan Livingston Seagull Then she took it a step further  reminding me that she enjoyed Jonathan Livingston Seagull when she was 13 In many ways  I think that says it all  I didnt know that much about the book except for the fact that a lot of people seem to have enjoyed it  It seemed to have acquired a reputation as contemporary wisdom literature  something someone would encourage you to read if you were feeling down or uninspired If I squint  I get some of that  This is a fable  so you have to accept a certain amount of easy narrative and simplified conflict  Santiago sets off on a quest  and everything lines up to make that quest possible Still  there is something unquestionably adolescent about the whole business  We are told repeatedly that the universe is built to make true the dreams of those who believe most firmly  Were assured that certain true believers  loosely defined so as to include those who fall truly in love  have a kind of secret path laid out for them they just have to be earnest enough in its pursuit I can see how some people might be inspired to hear such a message at certain low points in their lives  I cant see  though  how they can take it at all seriously  This is every bit as much a fantasy as Harry Potter  but  unlike there  were never invited to weight the real burdens of growing up  Instead  we are invited to stay within the confines of this comfortable  imagined strategy for confronting our individual destinies Perhaps worse  this sort of prosperity gospel for the irreligious seems to imply that failure is simply a lack of true faith in ones destiny  It suggests that  if we arent fulfilled  we need to see how we passed up on the opportunities and omens that would have made us so As a result  this is pernicious in the way it gives us a fantasy for the privileged  Santiago may begin as a poor shepherd  but hes always rich  literally so  in his capacity to choose the way in which he lives his life  This may not be about a seagull who see the world differently from his peers  but its the same entitled escapism  Most people fail to live their dreams because they are born into a poverty or connectedness that prevents them from selfindulgence  This book ignores that  Like the notorious Marie Antoinette  it invites everyone without sufficient bread simply to eat cake instead There is some fun here  and I like the way Coelho peppers the work with so many admiring references to Islam and the wisdom of other cultures  Plus  it reads easily  though I confess I grew bored with parts of it even though its a very short book Bottom line  I should have listened to my wife  Please keep an open mind as you listen  Dont try to over analyze the message If this is your first book on this kind of topic  theres a slight chance the message might not be received in its entirety  Understand how the human mind works  how it interacts  and how it affects you throughout your day first  and then youll be able to get the most out of this book The subject line really says it all  It s not a book I would recommend for everyoneit does become a little academic and dense at times in it s presentationbut I think I found myself talking about this book to others more than any other book I ve read the last few years  It was VERY thoughtprovoking and really had me reflecting on it s content as I walked around and dealt with the rest of my life  I know I m going to carry many key ideas away from it and into the future Honestly  while I respect and enjoy Malcolm Gladwell and those types of books  THIS is the book that I ve been looking for  Completely unexpected but also touchingly beautiful  Manages to touch on a number of very difficult subjects while still staying a light read  Bravo  Ive read a lot of books about similar subjects  In the end I usually feel like Im being sold something unattainable or the quick and easy guide to X and a better Y  The Comfort Crisis on the otherhand strikes a different tone  I didnt feel like I was being sold anything or promised anything  I felt like I was being shown a memory that Id forgotten  Something that I already knew but ignored or pretended was out of reach for good due to  insert excuse   I dont feel that Im alone in experiencing this kind of nameless yearning that I cant seem to drown with drink or trinkets  Theres something that I know that I at least am missing that Ive been conditioned to believe Im not missing  I thank the author and the amazing people he worked with to make this book come to life  If youre like me  this book will strike at the essence of your soul  100 worth the read  the reread  and the action itll inspire you to take  Thank you  Mike  I loved this book  It gave me some perspective on the importance of connecting with my young children and being mindful about how I react to them  I realized I no longer want to be an authority figure  but show them love and empathy while teaching boundaries  I highly recommend this book  Listening to Beginner s Mind  is a fertile sanctuary providing reassurance that paths are made by walking and the same is true for human and natural connections that flourish and flower  This will be listened to by me again and again   beautiful reading and music to carry the stories The narratives highlight a reverence for life s unfolding as guided by the returns of being in awe  moved and curious about people  the natural world and the hopes of reducing others  strife  and the power of music and art in all that ties us to each other  nature and the expansion of what sustains a better life for each other Regardless of vocation  the concepts resound and reassure the path worth walking  As a physician scientist  the concepts align with  patientcentredness  which drives everything good in science and healthcare whether qualitative or quantitative  the curiosity  humility and awe of others  experiences and responsiveness to these inform science as a changing  productive and glorious field     art and music seem kindred in this    in all walks  continually refreshing this listening referential frame of ourselves and other as  new sandcastles await building each day  are elemental to that which  binds us together as a humanbeings  and I would add to the natural world Thank you for this lovely piece of sustenance in life and work LAS I love this book  I have laughed out loud and cried while reading this book and will most likely relisten and feel all the emotions again  The Rose Code by Kate Quinn is my favorite book  I was immediately pulled into the story of 3 different women who under normal circumstances would never meet  They had the common desire to serve their country  The main 3 characters are young women from different walks of life   1  Oslo  nicknamed Princess  2  Beth  a young woman who had lack of self confidence  3 Mabe  another woman who wanted to improve her station in life  They meet and work at BP in different capacity  They work on breaking codes  There is deceit  friendships  hope  heartbreak and an awesome twist  I loved the story The Rose Code by Kate Quinn is one of the best audiobooks that I have listened to this year  I absolutely loved it  Thank you NetGalley for allowing me to review this book before publication  I loved it so much that I purchased my own copy  The storyline moved so well and the characters were intriguing  The author is fantastic with her imagery and added so many factual details  The narrator  Saskia Maarleveld really brought the characters to life with her voice and emotions  This is a standalone listen by the author of The Alice Network and The Huntress  I loved the twists in this book and learned some things from the time period too  Kudos to the author on not letting me guess who the spy was  Old white guy here  if that matters  I have to say I was gobsmacked at how good this is  I was anxious to read it after reading the glorious NYT review  so I got it the day it was released  yesterday  and just finished it  Wilkerson s reportage  analysis  synthesis  and conclusions are spectacularly insightful  Everything she says resonates so perfectly that throughout the book I was thinking   Ah hah  Yes  This is so illuminating  She has it just right   And that was my tone consistently  There were no lulls  no headscratching offshoots  If someone living in the US or curious about the US reads only one book even only tangentially related to race  let it be this one  Goodness  what a terrific book  And the narration by Robin Miles is flawless  Wow  This book was recommended by Jim Rohn in a speech I listened to and I have so much admiration for him I instantly hopped on audible and picked this up  The parable format was perfect for an audiobook and I ve already listened through a few times I can t say anything in this book is outside the realm of common knowledge  but a lot of times I don t need to learn something new  I just need to be reminded of those core fundamentals  and if I m not doing them start The 7 Cures for a Lean Purse discussed in the bookStart thy purse to fatteningControl thy expendituresMake thy gold multiplyGuard thy treasure from lossMake of thy dwelling a profitable investmentInsure a future incomeIncrease thy ability to earnThe one that has been the biggest game changer for me has been  Start thy purse to fattening  saving 10 of my income  I ve always heard  pay yourself first   but I always felt like if I did that I wouldn t have the money to pay my bills  If I had money left over after paying all of my bills I d save that Guess what  There s always something else to spend on so I wasn t saving much This book inspired me to just try it  and the results have been huge for me  Not huge in terms of my bank account  but more with my attitude towards money  Shortly after starting the process of setting aside 10  I started to feel in control of the money instead of the money being in control of me I think the mental shift has to do with when you spend everything  there s never enough  As soon as you start setting aside that 10 your mentality shifts from there never being enough to   Of course there is enough  I don t even have to spend everything I earn and I m doing just fine   I don t know if that makes sense  I think it shifts your subconscious from the scarcity mindset to a prosperity mindset Fringe benefits with 10 of my income being mine to keep  is that potential negative life events  worries  don t hold the same power over me because I have a little cash reserve that s growing every paycheck  If I get a cavity  blow out my knee  lose my job  have car problems  they ll still all be unfortunate and stressful  but they won t send me into crisis mode Typing this I m thinking about a quote from Mark Twain  I ve had a lot of worries in my life  most of which never happened  The mental benefits of saving calm a lot of my worries and let me focus on more productive thoughts  If they never happen I ll be glad I didn t waste my time worrying and if they do  I ll be in a position financially to deal with them This has been my long winded way of saying  buy the book  You won t regret it  If you already know it all  it will be good to go through the checklist and make sure you re actually doing it  If you re new to the study of personal finance  this book hits on the fundamentals and would be a great place to start  Wow  this was such a good book  I laughed  I cried  I cringed  There was good  bad and ugly but it was all real  I dont think a book has ever given me simultaneous feelings of such pride and shame for history  I really hope someday that Quanahs home can be restored  If you google it  its still there in Oklahoma but is in disrepair  I gave 5 stars for performance and 3 for story  Mindy is very funny  and I like her style  so I liked the book  Like Tina Fey in Bossypants  Mindy writes about things that all women can relate to  and that most women agree with on some level  She does an excellent job of reading  some authors don t do as well as you would want   maybe since she s also an actress  She definitely gave excitement to the reading  Her voice is a little highpitched  but again  I like Mindy so I enjoyed listening  The male readers were AWESOME and believable I gave 3 for story because she is quite superficial and materialistic  so you ll find those themes running through the entire thing  It s funny  especially if you re being lighthearted about it  but it s not the kind of story that keeps you thinking and expands you as a person  The story itself is pretty forgettable  but it was very fun and enjoyable while it lasted  I m assuming that was her goal  Yes  the narrator is the author  so maybe that counts for something  But man  he just goes so far over the top overweighting his words so often  it s pretty comical at times  The sample is a bit misleading  because Collins is just getting warmed up in that  A few more pages in  and He Is Speaking Like A Triumphant Graduate Student Who Has Just   Found   The   PROOF   That   Discipline  DISCIPLINE   is the Key Narrative comedy aside  there is a lot of worthwhile information here  though when you boil it down there s a lot of the obvious here  Also in late 2010 the discussion of Circuit City and Fannie Mae as  great companies  is a bit ridiculous and some of the companies discussed as great have attained their greatness in part by lessthanmoral means that have come to light in the years of increasingly ubiquitous internet since the book s publication  Still  Collins  articulation is highly accessible and wellordered  making  the obvious  easier to digest and retain  4 stars for content  2 stars for narration  3 stars  What did you like best about this story  I had read the books years ago  and decided to listen to the audio books now  as well  as a way to become reinvested in this amazing story before delving into Leigh Bardugo s new book   King of Scars   And I am so very glad I have One day I read a random blurb from a random book titled Shadow and Bone when I was perusing the aisles of a small bookstore  and I bought the book on a whim  I had never heard of the series  or even the author for that matter  Now  however  I consider Shadow and Bone to be the book that sparked this need inside of me to read all the time  After I read Shadow and Bone  I went on to read 60 books in just over two months  And I haven t slowed much since  That is thanks to Leigh Bardugo and this beautiful world she created I experienced elated devastation when I finished reading the series  but I got to experience it anew with the audiobooks  The narrator  Lauren Fortgang  is a favorite of mine anyway  but I truly don t think anyone else could have come close to her perfection in regards to this series  Her ability to project the kind of feeling and emotion necessary for a story like this is second to none  It wasn t just the story that had me in tears  but the depth of Lauren s ability to make me feel how the characters felt  Alina Starkov needed Lauren s voice to tell her story  And now that I am about to listen to Nikolai s story  I amthanks to Lauren s amazing talent firmly reconnected to this world of Grisha that began my obsession with all things magic  I couldn t be happier in this moment  Having to wait until the end of the book to find out what series this one previously tied into was frustrating but made a lot of sense afterwards On its own it is an awesome series and I look forward to seeing more of it  Title says it all  Listened to 3 hours for maybe 2 good points  Author goes off on unrelated or tangents and unnecessary details  I have read and reread the LoTR books many times  and this was my first time listening to them as an audiobook  I was prepared to be disappointed but was instead very pleasantly surprised  It seemed to me that the plot moved much faster when listening to the books than when I read them  In any case  these are among my very favorite  if not my favorite  books ever  The story is great  but there is so much more to these books than just a great story  There is a tremendous amount of wisdom that infuses these books  If youve read these books  you know what I mean  If you havent  you really must read them  Before I finish  I will say that the narrator is excellent  He infuses the different characters with personality and full credit to how he handles all the songs  I found that listening at 1 25x speed was just right  This book is up there with Malcolm Xs biography  another book that has changed my life for the better  Save yourself the time and just google  value investing Benjamin Graham   Most of the book is spent convincing you of the concept with a myriad of examples  all from the late 19th and early 20th century  Rather than update the book  you get it as it was written decades ago with ancient examples one struggles to relate to and then at the end of the chapter the footnotes bring it up to date  Ben is always referencing tables and charts  which kind of defeats the purpose  for me at least  of an audio book  I highly respect Graham and value investing  but if your already convinced it s a good strategy  then you really just need chapters 14 and 15  Let me start off by saying that I adore CEG have watched the series several times but there was something that I just couldn t connect with in this book  It s not that it was  bad   but it wasn t  good   I didn t laugh  I had been so excited to get it  and then        meh To be fair  I didn t listen past the first hour  that s about 20 of the book   but I didn t want to  Then  when I got back into my car on three different occasions  I chose a different book each time  That tells me that I probably would never finish it  and I should just go ahead and exchange it For a funnier experience with a similar vibe  try Jenny Lawson s Furiously Happy or Let s Pretend This Never Happened  Isekai harem story at its best  Please add the rest of this series to audible  Eagerly looking forward to books six and beyond  Thanks for writing  Like too many Americans  my educational background in economics is weak  Therefore  much of Zakarias narrative was a valuable learning experience  The vision communicated transformed what we are experiencing from a miserable personal narrative into a pivotal point in human history  Given my age  it is unlikely I will live to know whether the most dire predictions come true or whether the optimistic possibilities are achieved  I am giving copies of the book to the young adults I love most  I am very well off  retired  and very happy  and have a zero hour work week   but I still read lots of self help books  along with many other subjects  to better understand the human condition and what works and what doesn t  I find most self help books  including this one  largely just a updated How to Win Friends and Influence People   a good book   but this author seems particularly slimy to me  He describes his technique for winning a fighting competition by dehydrating himself to drop two weight classes then rehydrating before his bouts  Then  instead of actually fighting  he used his weight advantage to push competitors out of the ring  winning on a technicality  He points out this was out of the box thinking and within the rules  Both true  but it was not within the spirit of the rules or of the competition  It saddens me that others may emulate this fellow One of things I have learned from the many selfhelp books I have read  is a large number of them are written by selfabsorbed people who just want to get richer  One thing I take from this  and the book Stumbling on Happiness  is  dont take advice from anyone you dont want to be like  I absolutely do not want to be anything like this author Next was a key aspect of book   what is your goal   The author recommends using  excitement  as a better goal than  Happiness  as happiness is too vague  Excitement is nice  but it is not happiness  Excitement is easier to understand and measure than happiness  unfortunately excitement is ultimately unfulfilling and hollow  Related to this is the author s idea of DreamLining  This is a process of mapping out the costs and steps to achieve your dreams  The part about documenting  costing  and steps are very good  but using your dreams as goals tends to be unwise  Dreams are great  but tend not to be the best way of planning ones life  This is well described in one of my favorite selfhelp books Stumbling on Happiness  This author thus has goals that seem rather foolish to melike travelling to Europe to go to all the hottest night clubs  or shooting lots of automatic weapons  and winning companions on technicalities  It is indeed much harder to find what truly makes you happy than what excites you or what you dream about  yet this is truly at the core of every great self help book  This is not that book  He does point out that some people may have moral qualms about taking his advice  like advertising and selling things that don t really exist to see if there is a market  then cancelling the orders if you don t decide to go forward   I found quite a bit of the advice here to be mildly disgusting  The author also seems to say there are many other techniques he uses that  for obvious reasons  he can t describe  I presume because these techniques are not just immoral  but illegal  The best things said in this book are old  like Goethes advice to DO IT  START IT NOW  Decide on your goals and document concrete  achievable  steps  then do them There is a lot of other technical advice in this book that is now largely obsolete as the technologies and services describe have changed The narration was very good  The author of  A Thousand Ships   Natalie Haynes  has said that The Iliad is rightly considered one of the great foundational texts on war and warriors  men and masculinity  She is entirely correct  but as more and more people are finally allowed their voices in the spheres of literature  film  television  and pop culture were beginning to revisit classics from the point of view of those that were rarely considered in the past  Indeed  we seem to be living in a wonderful golden age of reinterpretations of The Iliad and The Trojan War  In the last ten or so years weve been given a pantheon of stellar interpretations of one of the western worlds greatest epics Madeline Miller  Circe and Song of Achilles   Pat Barker  The Silence of the Girls and its upcoming sequel The Women of Troy   Colm Toibin  House Of Names   and even the great Stephen Fry  the soon to be released Troy  have shown or will soon show one of our oldest stories in an entirely new way  With that new perspective were finally seeing historys greatest war from the point of view of the women who fought  died  or survived it  Its far too commonly forgotten that women werent just slaves  servants  or prizes of war during the conflict  They were warriors  goddesses  and queens  The roles of women in the Trojan War were as diverse and eclectic as the men s  Their heroics were just as laudable  their sacrifices just as profound  A woman fought Achilles  a woman killed HighKing Agamemnon  a woman helped save the kingdom of Ithaca  a woman brought the war to a standstill  Its baffling that its taken this long for them to get their due I was fortunate enough to get my hands on a physical copy last year and I quickly found that Natalie Haynes was ably continuing the work Madeline Miller started with  Circe    A Thousand Ships  is a vague sort of anthology that gives the forgotten women of the Trojan War their voices at long last  We learn about them as people and come to understand and sympathize with their plight with incredible swiftness  Haynes has a remarkable read on the culture and weaves multiple story threads deftly and precisely and I was compelled to finish the entire book in one sitting  While there is the cruelty  casual misogyny  and sexual violence that would ve been an unfortunate reality of that era   A Thousand Ships  is also surprisingly funny and witty at times  Especially where Penelope is concerned  While I still think the aforementioned  Circe  is the gold standard of the modern feminist retellings of The Trojan War   A Thousand Ships  has definitely earned its place of honor next to  Circe    Song Of Achilles   and  The Silence of The Girls   Give it a read and pray to the gods we get more like it  Your Brain at WorkHelp  be more effective and avoid burn out  Handle various projects with focus  bring more attention  be resourceful and work collaboratively  IntroductionEmily and Paul go through their day  The smartest neuroscientists explain this  Take 1 and take 2 that brings about changes  Act 1 Problems and DecisionsScene 1 the morning information overwhelm Prefrontal cortex is the biological seat to your conscious interaction with the world  To thinking things through when you are on autopilot through out your life  We ourselves generate information to the prefrontal cortex  and not influenced from outside  It needs to have everything just right otherwise it wont function well  You can compare the prefrontal cortex to a stage  Compare the information processed to be actors  Conscious mental activity has to be limited to one  just like you cant climb a mountain and talk at the same time  Similar to the light needed to light up the stage  Doing physical work while thinking  Basal Ganglia is a part of the brain that drives routine activity without much attention  Decision making and impulse control takes much of the prefrontal cortexs performance  Take lemon with some sugar or glucose Stop and pay close attention  focus when you face a multitude of actors on stage  Mental stage is a limited resource like financial assets that have a tight hold on spending  Put the best use of your asset to work without wasting it  Prioritise  See how a helicopter toy that needs a charge to fly  So is prioritising  a power hungry beast Some actors are harder to get on stage than others  Bringing recent activities as opposed to long past events  You might take a long time to guess what you ate 10 days back than what you had last night  prioritize with fresh mind Use visuals to process information in your minds eye  Visualising things activates the occipital lobe in the back of your brain  This region is activated by image  storytelling  or metaphors  Get things out of your head  Reduce the load on stage whenever possible  Conserve energy  Minimise energy usage to maximise performance  Its easy to make a tough decision in 30 mins when you are on fresh on every conservation mode  Experiment with different timings than topics   deep thinking meetings routine tasks  divide these into blocks of time  Yo let your brain recover just like your muscles  Even youre thinking  Mix things up like a work out  be disciplined about when not to think  To nonurgent tasks until its too essential  To delegate  Perhaps not to think at all until u have answers on all layers possess all information needed to process  Morning information overwhelm  Take 2Save energy for comparing prior to put em on stage  Focus on the top priority items that may look harder to see small wins  Surprises about the brainConscious thinking is a precious resource  Prioritise prioritising  save mental energy for prioritising  Scene 2 A project that hurts to think about Mental stage  A person can normally hold upto 7 items in mind at a time  which was later refuted  and told to be 4  You cant squeeze 40 actors on a stage that can hold only 4 at a time  Comes down to competition on what actor gets priority  Likely the number of items to hold at a time can be 2  ie  to turn left or right  or 3 or 4 max  Similar to how chess players focus of few chunks at a time to make the best decision  Sometimes breaking your projects into stages and put them into chunks of time  Scene 3 Juggling five things at once  Talk on phone  walk to find the room  two items overwhelming your prefrontal cortex in a situation for finding a room for interview  How much information you can collect at a time vs how you are able to process them  actors can hold only one role at a time  You cant process so much without impacting performance  Accuracy and performance drop off when you do too many tasks at once  Ex driving and talking in different places and situations  Brain cant do two things at once  Finish one operation before beginning one cos the stage is small  Dual task interference  Its actually not exactly about two things at once but actually about doing two conscious tasks at once and is called dual task interference  Impact of doing too much  Get the audience to do more work  Ex learning to drive a car in different bits  parking  shifting gears  reverse etc  the basal ganglia moves millions of muscles in an order once you set up it up  it learns it and then performs it  For ex how you learn to sip a hot glass of drink by sipping it first  Bottleneck is what prevents prior decisions that need to be answered before the one that in queue can be answered  Reducing queues can be effective to mix up and use attention  Scene 4 saying no to distractionsPeople change attention and do things every three minutes  How Microsoft experimented with supplying big monitors to their employees try to avoid external distractions  like turning off your smart phone to think and work well  there are more internal distractions  Because the nervous system is configuring and reconfiguring information every single second like random actors jumping on to the stage for a 2 minute fame  People can hold their thought for 10 secs  Lapses in attention involves activating prefrontal cortex  How to inhibit wrong things from coming into focus  Develop a pattern  If your brain notices a pattern  it is able to perform actions faster  When we are distracted  we are always thinking about ourselves  So its better to avoid letting your brain make up mental pictures Scene 5 searching for the zone of peak performance  The peak performance The inverted you  performance was poor at low levels of stress  You stress positive stress to help perform well  Arousants help by bringing urgency to tasks  a kind of fear  Too much arousal and under arousal and over arousal arent good things  Too stimulations for too many things isnt good it triggers too many activities on your prefrontal cortex  Like oestrogen  Ex how women  men handle deadlines  also the arousants level  under and over arousal can influence  There should be just the right levels  Peak performances require the right amount of stress  not the minimum   penopropylene and dopamine are the two which help you  Scene 6 getting past a roadblock Sometimes the conscious prefrontal cortex is alone not enough when it comes to being more creative on demand  Impass is something that is like a writers block  That doesnt let you recollect things like a friends name from the past  Mostly when you are creative  you encounter impasses unlike noncreative people  You should move from impasses to insights  Getting around an impass is really necessary to streamline the thought process  ex Turing the traffic on a bridge  You will have to stop the traffic to be able to drive around  And most insights happen when you are in the shower  They say it has a thing to do with water and active ways to diminish the thinking  Get it out of the way  and the solution will appear  clarity of distance  This gives you a good perspective to solve the problem from a distance  Sometimes not knowing everything is okay  one person who has all the info  a person who has very little info on the same problem can solve it together than them trying to solve it separately  you have to be creative on command  The right anterior temporal lobe  aria  awareness reflection insight action  The right hemisphere for insights is important  thats why you kinda quiet down when they are trying to focus  sometimes you have to get all the actors on stage  so that unconscious thoughts can solve the problem  Quiet mind with minimum electrical activity  insights happen when you are so relaxed and happy  The right hemisphere is the Bridge between the information you hold and the specific data  reduce the anxiety quieting your mind focus to see patterns and connections and links from a high level than getting into detail  Stop and focus on insights when they occur Intermission Meet the director  Metacognition  thinking about ur thinking  Metaawareness  being aware of ur awareness  Knowing yourself is the first thing to change  Step out of ur skin and looking at yourself through the eyes of another person can help you get a meta perspective of yourself  Without self awareness  you dont get what your capacity is  putting the director under a microscope  The idea of living in the present  Mindfulness is a trait and can be developed  MINDFUL AWARENESS ATTENTION SCALE  MAAS to measure mindfulness of individuals  everyone has a default network when you think about yourself and gives an narrative  The brain holds vast information about yours and those of other people  Your brain weaves a giant tapestry with this information  and thus displays mindfulness  ACT 2  Stay cool under pressure Scene 7  Derailed by dramaLabelling  arousal Scene 8  drowning amid uncertainty  the brain is good at recognising patterns and predicting them  The predicting capacity involves more than your 5 senses  40 emotional cueues your brain can pay attention to at any given time  The only certainty is more uncertainty  When you cant predict the outcome of something  your brain sends an alert to pay more attention  A sense of not being able to predict the future generates more uncertainty  Autonomy and certainty are two things to consider  the feeling of being in control reduces the stress and increase your autonomy  The perception of choice matters to the brain  three types of reappraisals  Cognitive reappraisal can help differentiate and gives insight and reinterpreting an event  Reduces uncertainly and increases sense of control  Scene 9  when expectations get out of controlYou can see only problems  but upward spiral lets you see more than the problem  Happy people see a wider range of data and are able to make better decisions  Happiness is a great state for mental performance  Live with good amount of novelty  and creating right expectations  manage expectations  and setting the scene for the future  Minimise the threat to increase the odds of your rewards or possible outcomes in most situations  To pay attention to possible expectations which you know for sure  This helps you maintain a good level of dopamine  ACT 3  Collaborate with others  the need for food  water  shelter  these social needs  if not met  is kind of a threat  Scene  10  Turning enemies into friends When you sense a foe  you dont interact them with them normally  and feel no empathy and less sense of collaboration  and makes you feel lesser than them  It changes how you interact when you think of someone as a competition  These mistakes generate more threat responses  You can get easily upset and discord their ideas  dont get emotionally charged  Defuse the natural foe state to do some difficult thinking  Going from foe to friend  handshake  having a coffee  discussing something you have in common  discussing weather or traffic to cause oxytocin release  have shared experiences and likely to treat them as a friend  this works when you turn strangers into friends  To offset the feeling of foe  have shared experiences  Have shared goals vs competing goals to let people relate too  Its highly impactful  Scene  11  When everything seems unfairsometimes you may get a deeper sense of unfairness  by someone painting a misleading intent about someone else  When you tag someone as a foe  its even more difficult  You have to be extra careful in these situations  You may get intimidated when theres no fairness and kinda feel everyones treating you unfairly  Prefrontal cortex tends to shrink when you hit puberty  increase sense of fairness an increase level of dopamine and oxytocin  This lets you collaborate with a great sense of belongingness  employees feeling of unfairness may be contributing to their physical and mental health  Increase the feeling of collaboration to make people feel decisions were made fairly  It affects the cortisol levels and the longevity of life itself  A sense of fairness can be a primary reward  Scene 12  The battle for statusYou raise your status vs someone else  or perhaps your own selves from the past  To play against yourself  youd need to know yourself  Increase your capacity and get faster in reading others mind  You increase relatedness when you share  and are able to make better decisions and collaborate with others  5 domains of social experience that your brain treats the same as survival issues  SCARF model  status  certainty  autonomy  relatedness  and fairness  If your status is attacked publicly and unfairly  and it can take years to recover from social pain  It comes back when you think about it again  unlike physical pain which is gone  change your focus to make your oxytocin level increase  Youll get an insight  ACT 4  FACILITATE CHANGEbrain constantly changes based on external factors  but can also be changed by changing peoples attention  Scene 13  When other people lose the plot When you review your own work  you have a pressure to make it look good  The idea of protecting your status  and the brain is focussed only that what you did was right  When you read someone elses works  you tend to find mistakes so very easily  They lost the plot  when they feel threatened  Focussing on the solution helps you get better results  And dont put people use their energy is defending themselves and channel it to drive the solution  Scene 14  The culture that needs to transformFacilitating change in another person is not easy  as much as it is over a group of people with diverse characters  Change is hard and so is their behaviour  Using a blunt instrument to change approach will not help as emerged from behaviourism with a conditioned response  like the carrot and stick method  u can try this with kids  but not with adults  where its perceived as a threat  and will lead to arguments and fights  Real change required repetition  Repeated attention  Frequency  duration  and the intensity  When you make a promise  and your brain brings it up as often as it can  Ex learning music  repetition  and the effects of rehearsal  in a garden  theres always sunlight  but very less rain  So you gotta water it as often as possible  Water them in small amounts  regularly  to get people to change  let them collaborate  and talk about it regularly  and have people share their thought  It can also be beneficial to see where others attention is  pay attention to everyones attention and to focus their attentions into the new ways  Self developed neuroplasticity  Being heavily cognitive or being goal focussed can make situations worse  Sometimes  giving people power has upside and can cause impact with their intent  EncoreThe latter Emily and Paul have good life at office  family  and personally  they have strong directors  and can stand apart and are able to observe their brain functions and are able to make small changes  Microscopic changes can account to massive behavioural responses to the small stimuli  Self awareness is very important  Dont allow external factors to drive your brain  Understand the machinelike nature of your brain  to build your director  That way  youll be able to bring about change in you  others  and perhaps  the world itself  should be able to shut the prefrontal cortex to be more creative   Dillinger  Floyd  Nelson were not part of the  Mafia    More of a history of mob  Didn t get into the Law taking down the mob until the last couple of chapters  Liked the story though  Found the tie in to Hollywood interesting  Just thought it would be about law enforcement aspects BTW   LOVED THE REST OF THE SERIES   Deceptive intentions are just not my way  I love great business recommendations  Second motives will not accomplish anything and karma is real  I will go back to Brian Tracy  What did you love best about The Song of Achilles  Sometimes a useful delusion is better than a useless truth  Colson Whitehead  The Underground RailroadI loved the book  I read it right after reading the recent Blight biography of Frederick Douglass  Frederick Douglass Prophet of Freedom  I was in the mood  I also read it after Whitehead s most recent  devastating novel  The Nickel Boys  So  I was definitely well prepared to step down into Whitehead s world Interestingly  a lot of what I enjoyed about this novel were items called out by other reviewers as negatives  I loved the structure of the novel  The Underground Railroad being literal adds a bit of magical realism to the novel  It isn t a novel about the Underground Railroad  It IS a novel about slavery and being black in America  and the Underground Railroad is simply the frame that allows Whitehead to move the narrator forward and backward through time and space to describe different characteristics of what it means to be a slave in the South in America  Fantastic A second critique of the novel that I actually found both critical and important is that just as you were getting to know a character  they would die or disappear  clearly  these reviewers weren t fans of Game of Thrones   That perceived flaw  for me  was a brilliant device where Whitehead is able to transfer to the reader just a bit of how disruptive and disjoined the life of a slave must have felt  You form connections and BAM you are sold  You love someone and SNAP they are ripped from you  In life  those connections are never tied off neatly  People disappear  They die  Stories get left untold  Those shifts come suddenly and painfully  especially under slavery s hard hand and cruel lash Some reviewers were irritated by some of the language  behavior  or cultural anachronisms of the novel  This isn t meant to be historical fiction  This is magical realism  This is emotional fiction  So  I m not sure I need it to have a perfect verisimilitude to preCivil War America  If Whitehead s anachronisms were accidental  which I doubt  that might be different  but I believe Colson Whitehead is aiming not just to tell a story about slavery  but about racism and his target isn t the Antebellum South  but our modern racist present AND the way we enslave others beyond chains  What  You mean there weren t actually trains running back and forth underneath the South  I might be wrong  but I wouldn t bet your freedom on it Finally  there is the irritation about it winning the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2017  It must be bad  It won a prize  First  I m fond appropriating a quote from Willam Gass where he apologized after winning some prize  saying he would try better next time  There is a certain truth to the fact that prize winners tend to often gravitate towards safe picks  Often  those committees steer towards consensus and safe  but that doesn t also mean they sometimes don t get it right  Whitehead has produced  again and again  great fiction  Is he also writing fiction that sells  Sure  but so did Dickens and Twain  Does winning the Pulitzer Prize somehow diminish the book itself  No  that is silly  Does it mean in 2017 there were no better novels published  Absolutely not  I could almost guarantee that outside the realm of prize fiction  and bestsellers  some of the best fiction lies underappreciated and unread by most  That was the case for MobyDick for years and a lot of people consume mediocre shit most of the time  just look at the most popular restaurants   But popular and wellknown novels can also kick ass  Q E D  the lies of the last year finally shown the light of truth  thank you Steve and Todd What made the experience of listening to The Happiness Project the most enjoyable  Jack Carr has cemented his place as one of the top espionage thriller authors  A few years ago I would have thought this book was good but not plausible  Now  completely believable and plausible  I dont find Carr to be too preachy  like all people he has an opinion  Whether I agree or not he can express his through his writings Ray Porter does should receive an award for his narrating abilities This book has my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank You  Love him or hate him  he s one damn smart man  My hope is that more people my age  2035  would read and try to understand the work of Dr  Peterson  I see so many young adults that have drank the  Woke  coolaid and have suffered immensely because of it  This books release was synchronistic  I approached an area in my relationship that brought up a lot of insecurities  feelings of low self worth  etc  I listened to this book in record speed because everything in it was exactly what I needed to hear to help handle the feelings of inferiority and self esteem issues I was facing  It helped to shine a light on a lot of the ways I am codependent in my relationship  I cant thank you enough for this book  looking forward to integrating what I learned from Dr Shefalis book into my life  Jason did a great job  Thomas Sowell is a national treasure  His writings should be mandatory in schools  I m so glad I discovered his work  Listening to  To Kill a Mockingbird  in 2014  what strikes me are the three eras  Here we have a very personal book written 54 years ago about a time 30 years in the past of the author  I constantly kept thinking about 1960 and 1930 and whether the same story would be told the same way by a modern version of Harper Lee Lee wrote fondly but with the judgement of an adult about a white child growing up in the south in the 1930 s  It s clear that the civil rights movement  though yet to really get started in 1960  was building to a boil at the time she wrote her one and only novel Lee tried to subtly apply her beliefs to the book and slowly separate the bigotry of the past  and her present  from the enlightenment that is even now slowly coming to our culture  Her writing is not unlike the true authors of the New Testament Gospels writing about the past decades later but writing for their time and for their audience  Lee s writing is with purpose but also knowing that if you beat the reader over the head with your message  you will lose them every time  No  you have to wrap the medicine in sweet candy and let the reader enjoy the sweet and endure the bitter It IS a sweet book and Atticus Finch is the kind of man we can all aspire to be  It s an important book that reminds us that there are good people and bad people everywhere and in every time  It s a great book that tells us that even though we are in many ways products of the culture we live in  right is right and wrong is wrong and we just can t let injustice stand simply because it s  acceptable  to our current society  It s an enjoyable book that takes us back to the innocence of childhood and portrays a very special set of relationships and how they appear to an 8 year old girl Beyond the book itself  there is also Sissy Spacek  I was concerned that her reading would not live up to the material  but I was wrong  I came to the book after watching and loving the movie  I worried that the voice of Scout I had heard from Kim Stanley  Scout as an adult  and Mary Badham  Scout as a child  in the movie would not be  right  coming from Ms  Spacek  However  all of her voices match perfectly  This is one time where the book and the movie are not in competition  The movie is as good as the book and just helps you see better than your imagination what Macom looked and felt like  Not to plug the movie here  but Lee and Horton Foote did a masterful job of taking this book and faithfully transferring it to the screen  No  not every detail from the book is in the movie  but it s still a complete telling of the story and was deserving of all of it s accolades  too This is not a riveting mystery or a great biography  This book is a timeless yet timely book so well crafted and with a clear message You need to listen to this book  Whether you are a baby boomer like me  a genXer  or a millenial  it s a great experience that will stay with you  This is apparently the product of some smart  hardworking researchers who have spent an amazing amount of time studying relationships and romantic interactions in minute detail  They swear they can tell which relationships will last and which won t  The scientific formula  It depends on whether you usually speak positively or negatively about your partner  It s not hard to imagine that someone who constantly criticizes their partner is unlikely to have a happy  healthy long relationship with them  That hardly seemed to need the intense scientific scrutiny But surely there s more to it  more to the book than that  right The book itself consists of eight date ideas  each with a suggested conversation  The date ideas are fine  They ll be fun for some people  but not a good idea for others  Ok  great  That could easily be a short listicle somewhere  As for the conversations  they are each important subjects  to be sure  Do they really benefit from being matched with the date ideas  Have the authors run experiments to determine that these eight dates each lead to more successful relationships  have they run scientifically controlled experiments with different permutations to figure out the exact ingredients that make these eight dates magically work  Maybe I missed it  but I heard no such thing  It sounded rather more like the authors discussed what they felt were the most important topics for relationship partners to discuss  then made up random ideas for dates in which to discuss each of those topics It isn t BAD mind you  Anyone who can go on regular  physical dates with their partner and is open to new experiences and getting to know their partner better should definitely consider giving this a try  I just expected more substance and scientific backing  Again  it s listicle material  But it s still not bad  so if you like  go ahead and do it  Just be aware that you ll only truly get value out of this book if you actually have those eight conversations  or possibly  the eight full dates  with a partner  it s not just a book you can read and set aside  I was searching for a book to keep my mind occupied during a rough patch  This book has an engrossing story  wonderful characters and a light mood which didnt add to my stress levels  I cherish this type of book which is a pleasure to read listen from beginning to end  It will be one that I listen to repeatedly  Looking forward to the next installment  It has some interesting concepts that I would say serve more as reminders than new concepts The story doesn t really offer anything new either  The dialog between the main characters is almost laughable at times because it feels like the author is trying to hard to make the monk sound sage but it comes off as a little tacky 3 stars because there were some interesting takeaways but unfortunately nothing new  I felt like I ve heard different versions of this story hundreds of times  Unhappy rich man goes on a spiritual journey to seek enlightenment  discovers he had it within him the whole time if only he had changed his perspective  goes on to share the knowledge  Which I think is a good story but I felt like this book was very surface level in it s delivery Entertaining at times but not something that I would strongly recommend  Quiet will definitely be included in my list for the top nonfiction books of 2012  This is strong praise indeed  given that we are barely in May  The book is that good that I find it inconceivable that 10 other better nonfiction books will be published this year The strength of Quiet surprised me  as I went into reading the book a strong skeptic about the whole concept of personality types  I m a sociologist  and I believe my bones that structure and situations determine behaviors as much as personality  I ve also been unimpressed by either the reliability or validity of tests that purport to predict or explain behavior  such as the MBTI  Nor can I confidently report where I fall on the introvert   extrovert scale  and would have a hard time making this judgment about either my spouse or my children If you  like me  are skeptical of personality types then you are ideally suited to approach Quiet  Every page of Quiet contained for me some revelation that caused me to rethink and reevaluate how I approach my relationships and my work  and how I interpret the actions of colleagues and family Cain s thesis is individuals vary on how we respond and react to stimuli  For some of us  external stimulus is energy giving and restorative  Other people may enjoy external stimulus  but interactions with other people subtract from the pool of psychic energy and can be depleting  Those people that we call  introverts  are those that expend energy in interactions   extroverts  gain energy What Cain points out is that our schools and our workplaces have been moving to a state where only the skills and behaviors of extroverts are valued  We want our kids to be assertive and confident  We get worried if our children are reserved  dreamy and quiet  At work we all operate in teams  We look to our colleagues to speak up and to proactively contribute to our discussions and team projects  The vision of the open office  designed to ease collaboration and break down barriers to communication  has captured the imagination of many managers   I know  I work in just such an open office plan  Cain believes  and cites lots of evidence to support her ideas  that our efforts to construct our schools and workplaces around only extroverts are counterproductive to our organizations and damaging to individuals  Families  schools and workplaces can be better off with a mix of personality types and styles  We need to design classrooms and workplaces that honor the needs of our colleagues for quiet focus and intensive solo pursuits Quiet is one of those books that is so beautifully written and so persuasively argued that one wants to convince everyone else to read along and discuss its conclusions  Sometimes I fantasize about having the sort of wealth that would allow me to hand out books to everyone I come across  Quiet tops my list of books to share so far in 2012  I m a 36 yr old woman who has ADHD and has suffered much stress  anxiety  shame from a severely disorganised adult life rarely planning ahead more than a month or so  And while realize this is not a cureall  I have more hope than ever before that I can get a handle on tasks  projects and life goals  Thank you so much  Thoughtprovoking  inspiring  a little preachy but otherwise VERY good   I agree with other reviews that this book starts off feeling a little anthonyrobbinesque  yes I did just make that word up haha   but I was intrigued to see where it went  and how it developed I found it extremely useful more as a springboard for exploring my own situation and my own limits  I am somewhat skeptical by nature  and so took the book as I do any selfhelp resource  with a good grain of salt and an open mind I would say that anyone expecting a manual for success will probably be somewhat disappointed  but anyone with the courage to look inside themselves and honestly ask what holds them back from happiness and success will find the book inspiring and thought provoking No book holds  the answers  in itself  but I think this book could help people to begin really  looking  for the answers I m listening to this for the 2nd time  and am buying a copy for a friend  I think that speaks as loud as any longwinded review  hm    This book relates the essential  and depressing  history of legal segregation in the US  However the book is structured predominantly of lists with scant connective tissue in between  If you listen to it  you come away with many examples of how the law was used to promote racial segregation  But you dont get an integrated picture of why this happened or how the legal pieces fit together  If you were reading it in print format  you would skim some of the examples and tarry over the connective segments  I recommend doing this  because the story is one Americans need to know  good book  nice to go back and relive my childhood  but the reader pronounces Voldemort  voldemore  through out the book and it annoyed me greatly  After reading the ebook I could not resist listening to Abby Craden narrating this story  Noyess obvious knowledge and love of horses runs through this book like a roaring river  Dewey is the third main character and is the most endearing animal character I have ever come across  His intelligence and curiosity of things all human and animal are so well written  If you are an animal lover but not so sure about the working of dressage do not worry  Noyes explains it all in the book and also the additional glossary  Do yourself a favour and buy this book in what ever form you enjoy  This is a great and thought provoking book  just what I ve come to appreciate and expect from Jared Diamond Unfortunately  the narration is so dull it makes it incredibly difficult to keep engaged with the story  His voice is monotone and devoid of meaningful inflections  and throaty  I keep waiting for him to clear his throat  it turns this in to a very dry listen  Significantly reduces my enjoyment of this incredible book  STORY  True Historical   I am not from the Pacific Northwest and I m not a rowing enthusiast  but this still was a great listen  It is for all Americans who like stories of courage and determination and people who have made their mark in history  The story begins as hopeful boys show up at Washington to try out for the university rowing teams  As the book progresses  the teams are chosen and begin their training  Alternately  you will get a glimpse of Berlin as it prepares to host the 1936 Olympic Games  The book goes back and forth between Berlin and Washington until the final American Olympic team is chosen and travels to Berlin It was interesting to hear details about the sport of rowing which I knew nothing about  I even looked on Wikipedia to see a diagram of the seating positions so I could understand the titles of the different rowers and how they contribute to the overall speed of the boat  What I enjoyed the most was the massive effort made by Hitler and the Nazis to hide the  real Germany  and appear to the world as a beautiful  peaceful Berlin  There was a little too much character development of each of the boys in the boat  but I suppose it contributed to the overall story  The best part of the book  of course  is the end when the Washington rowing team competes for the USA on the world stage  That is followed by an epilogue which updates each boy s life after the games PERFORMANCE  Good job  Some people from Washington complain about mispronunciation of local places  This Texas reviewer didn t notice a thing OVERALL  Recommended for just about anyone  There is no cursing  violence or sex  My only criticism is I thought it moved a little slowly at times  If you like history  science and the step by step retelling of discovery this book is for you  The author deftly weaves together events across time and from sites around the world to give a cohesive vision of illness caused by infection  war  disease and transformation brought about by science  At times heart wrenching and disturbing but an amazing read nonetheless  Excellent  While the author does a decent job at still bringing his  rules for life  to a broadly relevant sense  the deeper explanation of the  rules  are often rooted in religious biblical quotations  I felt this detracted from the overall applicability of the meaning as it was a bit of a turnoff for listeners who may have varying strengths in religious beliefs I was not able to finish the book  as it got to the point where the religious quotations became too much of an overtone  I would highly recommend this book for those with strong ties to biblical text as the material will likely resonate with their worldly perspective  However  I would caution those who may not find that as useful of a lens through which to evaluate the world  I actually SCREAMED in the middle of this book   When you get there  you will know what I m talking about   I ve been following Mary s career from the start with THE GOOD GIRL  which remains one of my all time favorite books  but LOCAL WOMAN MISSING is going to give it a run for its money  Thoughtful  real characters and perfectly paced prose are Mary s signature and she gets better with her talents in each book  And  no spoilers but the end is SO SATISFYING Thank you  Mary Kubica  You make reading so much fun  I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels like they give to others too much  and receive little to nothing in return  To those of us who feel like we cant say no to others and let other peoples emotions dictate our actions    to those of us who say yes to chores  or even social outings we do not wish to participate in to make another person happy    I never would have thought of myself as codependent  I think of myself as a strong  but giving leader  This book was a game changer for me  I now have the confidence to start setting boundaries  say no and even ask others for favors without that overwhelming feeling of guilt I used to have  I highly recommend this book  Dr  Nagoski s revisions were necessary  due to some partners  incomprehension of the difference between desire and pleasure  Thanks to Dr  Nagoski for recognizing this issue publicly and addressing it with this new edition  I am in academia myself and am aware of the fragility of some egos in this domain  Dr  Nabisco handled the communicative shortcomings in the previous book with utter professionalism and with an eye to collaborative and affirming communication  most especially toward men in heterosexual partnerships  Good communication is important in partnerships between people of any gender identity and sexual orientation  Another excellent Rivers of London adventure  This time it s Abigail investigating the mystery  I read the novella when it was released a few months ago and I have to say the narration makes for a much more enjoyable story   for me  anyway Abigail s dialog has a lot of slang in it  Not being a teenager or from London reading it left me puzzling out a lot of things  but Shvorne Marks  excellent narration makes it fairly obvious what she s saying  I was surprised how much I missed  now being very aware of the subtleties going on between the characters  The added inflection and emphasis to Abigail s dialog had me grinning too  getting her sarcasm  or jealousy  or poignancy  Her wittily accurate assessment of people  filtered through a teenager s perspective  had all the characters stepping off the page  There s also footnotes by Harold Postmartin for her more cryptic phrases  In the book I found it a bit distracting to back fit his explanations into what just happened  Kobna HoldbrookSmith  though  voices him perfectly  with his usual linguistic enthusiasm and delight at the changes being wrought on the language  Now I was enjoying his contributions and best of all  understanding the syntax All in all the narration enhanced What Abigail Did That Summer immensely  I found the mystery much easier to follow  along with all the supernatural happenings  beings  creatures and time shifts that populate the story  You get to learn more about the talking foxes as well as the depth of Abigail s character  Clever  intelligent  gaming the system  manipulating numerous situations to her advantage and dealing with unusual circumstances with poise and aplomb  at thirteen   Peter s right to feel threatened she ll surpass him   Start to finish it was an entertaining  vivid adventure  Well worth the listen  Mr  President Thank you for writing this beautiful book  it reads like poetry  so fluid  so pure  And  its perfect for such a time as this I am grateful for this book a healing balm to my soul Kindly ngela  I am giving this book 4 stars  not because the author was so spectacular  but because I think this book is very important as an intro to the Law of Attraction for people who really don t know much about it  After getting turned on to this stuff  and you want to know more  I recommend looking into Ask and It Is Given by Esther  Jerry Hicks  The Power of Intention by Wayne Dyer  and my favorite  The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire by Deepak Chopra  You will also hear a lot of quotes from other people in The Secret  I suggest looking deeper into their work if one of their quotes is especially meaningful to you  I first noticed Why We Sleep on Audible s homepage under quotNew in NonFictionquot and clicked on it simply because I saw it was narrated by one of my favorite narrators  Steve West  The subtitle quotUnlocking the power of sleep and dreamsquot makes this sound like it would be full of watered down science and generic advice about getting a good night s sleep or interpreting your dreams  That is NOT what this book is  thankfully  Matthew Walker presents study after study explaining why we need sleep for every aspect of our lives  to prevent disease  to help remember things  to look more attractive  etc    I was fascinated for all 14 hours of this book  I ve recommended it to every person I know  because the content of the book is just so IMPORTANT  The next time I hear someone say  quotOh  I only need 5 hours of sleep a night quot I will tell them how wrong they are and shove this book in their face  Seriously  everyone needs to READ THIS BOOK    Our society holds some really erroneous beliefs about sleep  from how much you should be getting a night  to whether you really have insomnia  you probably don t   Walker addresses everything you ever wanted to know about sleep and more in this book  I will be listening to this again soon  Im going to give you a future  I vow With you For as long as you want me Forever Jack and Stella have been friends for a long time and been in love since she was sixteen  After one night together their lives changed forever and they promise to keep their secrets buried and go their separate ways  Twelve years later when being around each other all the time becomes too much for them to resist  they finally give into temptation  When their past secrets become unburied  they will have to prove how strong their love is and stand together An extremely emotional ride from beginning to end that tissues are a must  Jack and Stella have had so much heartache and the pain that they have had to endure was unbelievable  I was completely invested in the story and had tears in my eyes for eighty percent of the book between ugly tears and happy tears  You could feel the chemistry between Jack and Stella vibrating off the pages and could tell that they were soulmates that just needed to finally get past their pain and heartache  I had an extreme book hangover after this one and recommend it to everyone  A TOP 2021 READ Audio Jason Clarke and Ava Erickson did an amazing job of bringing the characters and story to life and made it seem like we were living right in the story  Meegwetch for telling our story as real folks instead of as an old story  for giving us a modern presence that doesn t neglect our ancestors  Your words honor all of us   I m so glad I bought more credits to purchase this book as soon as it was released  The story is heartbreaking  captivating  and brave  The narration is excellent  I hope this book helps people to understand why victims remain silent for so long and how much courage it takes to speak out  Being victimized is far more complex than just being hurt and calling the police to  fix  it  I listened to the first 6 chapters of this book and appreciated the author s experience and the experiences of many others that he shared  I found the research about genetics and trauma extremely informative However  I am a survivor of childhood abuse and suffer from extreme CPTSD   ptsd that is a result of the caregiver being the perpetrator of the trauma  and I found the author to be lacking in his knowledge of and ability to address my particular experience In chapter 6 he begins to lead the reader  listener through an exercise in visualizing the parents as appearing before ones self and noticing the sensations in one s body as they take a step closer My stomach was clenched in knots and I felt terror and the urge to run as far away as I could get The author then urges the listener to feel the life force of the parents  I tried to follow along as best I could  denying my urge to turn off the audio  I felt the sensations of electric shocks  sharp and stinging throughout my body  I thought  this is because of the sharp stinging beatings I received constantly from my mother   The author goes on to give 4 options for the sensations the listener is feeling  He says that if you are feeling closed off or rejecting of your mother the problem is with You and not your mother  He says that one must imagine the mother with all the trauma she must have experienced and realize that she just dis not have the love to give  The examples of trauma that are given are that the mother is too preoccupied with her own traumatic experiences to be able to give the child the love they felt they should have had I find this author to have a gross misunderstanding and lack of knowledge surrounding child abuse  He seems to have a firm grasp on generational trauma and I understand the premise and intent of his book but these exercises could actually cause more harm than good for those of us who have suffered horrific abuse at the hands of those who were supposed to nurture us  This book has an amazing story  and It starts out with all guns blazing  The premise was astoundingly brilliant and I was hooked Buthalfway throughI had to abandon the book  Simply because I can  A wellwritten book would not allow me to do that  The story is cold  I honestly think some warmth and affection could redeem it  A character or two who hooks you and therefore guides you through the cold  empty  and lonely story spaces  But then again considering the storylineit s a bit paradoxical  if the story is going for accuracythen cold and lonely is accurately depicted I feel no connection to the characters  More annoyance than anything for their lack of development  and lack of development with each other  I think the author tries with Holsten and Lane  but it was not enough  I felt slightly affectionate for the spiders as they evolve and selfactualizeabsolutely brilliant and a mirror to humanitybut I could not feel any real connection to them  and whenever it was their story s turn  I endured a cold  creepy feeling all throughout while imagining them But such technically intelligent concepts about space  technology  AI  evolution  and science  I can t help but be totally impressed by the author s knowledge and imagination  Butlike the observation of so many other readers  the story needed better execution to pull it along and see it through  This is a hard review to write because I loved so much about this book but it took awhile to get there  I was struggling in the first part of this book because it felt little one dimensional with characters development and relationships  I wasn t sure if I liked anyone  Then as things progressed and hardship set in the characters grew and became so much more  Elsa was a hard characters for me because she was so insecure about herself and sometimes felt almost emotionless but then when it came to her kids she found an inner strength that made her seem so strong and then she would go back to her insecurities which I imagine was the point  to show she never really lost her insecurities about herself no matter how strong she became  The story line was so filled with hardship and heartache that it reminds us how much people suffered  The ending and the epilogue was so hard to listen to but really brought the entire story and impact home for me I personally do not know anything about the Dust Bowl but after this book I have found myself researching to try to understand how this could have happened  This is my favorite thing about Historical Fiction and Kristin Hannah s books  I find I always learn so much about the past that seems forgotten when we should never forget  At the end of the audiobook there is an interview with Kristin  Julia Whelan that was very interesting  I loved hearing the process and how much the story changed from the original idea to a released book Julia Whelan is an incredible narrator  For me she can make me forget she is reading a book and instead I feel like I am there  She captures all of the emotions and characters so well  I never write reviews  but I as I finished this book I felt like I had to  I was sucked into the story and began to care about the characters quickly  The story ticked a lot of boxes for me as well  such as political intrigue  magic fantasy elements  romance  intelligent strong female characters   and a bit of witty humor  The performance by the narrator was really good as well  She used varies voices  accents  and intonation for many characters as well as had nice speed timing throughout the story If these qualities seem like something youd enjoy  I highly recommend giving this book a chance  I definitely was not disappointed   Of the 30 books I ve listened to since 2009  The Devil in the White City is one of the best experiences  Erik Larson s writing is sublime  He conjures the Chicago of the late nineteenth century so clearly that he might be documenting events that occurred yesterday  The stories about the design  organization  and construction of the 1893 Chicago World s Fair as well as the personalities involved are all utterly fascinating  The macabre portions that deal with serial killer Dr  H  H  Holmes are so bizarre as to almost be unbelievable  While listening to this book  I found myself continually thinking   Truth truly is stranger than fiction  Prior to my listen I was apprehensive about the narrator  Scott Brick  who had also done Ron Chernow s Washington A Life  I felt that Brick s reading of that book was slightly stilted  but his performance of Devil in the White City is pitch perfect  It isn t very often that I finish a book and then start it all over again immediately  I did so with Hamnet because I couldn t separate myself from the story  the characters  the language  I had to hear it again  This is one of those rare books that  once you start it  it pulls you in and keeps you there  Beautiful language  extraordinary images and  coupled with the masterful narration  this is a must read  not only for english majors and those interested in Shakespeare  but for all of those who wish to be inspired and reminded that some authors just simply have a gift  Another Ted Dekker pageturner  I couldnt put it down  or turn it off  I listened to the Audible version   Toward the end I got a little nervous thinking  Seriously  THIS is how its gonna end   But  trust me  hang in there  the ending really is good I think I remember the author saying on Facebook that this story didnt have any deep hidden lessons in it  He was mistaken  There are some very enlightening and convicting truths woven into this fictional story  in true Ted Dekker style  as it should be The performance was great  but the Audible recording itself skipped or repeated in several places throughout  But the story was good enough that I quickly got over it Great story  Thanx  Ted  Cant wait for the next one  I m ashamed to say that during High School I made the grave mistake of using cliff notes to get through reading Fahrenheit 451  I did that for most books in High School and College and am just now going back and reading the for the first time  Like Orwell s 1984  Fahrenheit 451 is as relevant if not even more so in today s culture The first thing that struck me about Fahrenheit 451 is that it s actually a pretty straightforward and easy ready  Unlike many books that are  assigned reading  Fahrenheit 451 has a straightforward premise  It s set in a world where firefighters instead of putting out fires  start fires by burning books  and anyone associated with them What rang true most of all was towards the middle of the novel there s a scene in which the main character  Guy Montag is interacting with his wife and her two friends  It s a scene in which he reads a couple verses of poetry and the reactions of each of the characters was so distinct and so different that it took me off guard  The way in which Bradbury is able to convey the dichotomy between wanting to be happy and avoiding reality is something I wrestle with  Do I ignore the injustice in the world for my own happiness or do I fully embrace the fact that there are horrors taking place all around me And that s what I loved most of all about Fahrenheit 451  it made me contemplate my own life  I didn t find the story to be overly satisfying  especially the ending  but the questions it raises are profound  And its because of that  that I m disappointed I hadn t read it earlier and urge anyone who likes my cliff noted my way through it to go back and enjoy this marvelous novel  There is a YouTube video of Admiral William H  McRaven giving a commencement speech at the University of Texas  It is about following ten principles that he learned from Navy Seal training to change himself and to change the world  This book adds depth to the ten principles with stories from his years in military service  Watch the video first  If you enjoy that  you ll probably enjoy the book  Military analogies for life lessons might not appeal to everyone  What made the experience of listening to Zero to One the most enjoyable  Too much fluff  This book took a good 2 hours to get into the actual Profit First system  Then when it really gets started he intertwines stories about other people and hypothetical situations about not following the system  I got fed up with the useless stories and fluff and found a youtube video that explained the system to me in 20 mins WITH visual references  The system itself is great but this book could be alot shorter and more to the point  This is a very practical book  filled with tools that can be put to practice the moment you re done with it  The examples that it presents are very useful in tiying up all the theory it adresses I ve read reviews that complain the audio book makes reference to graphs and charts not available in the audio format  Though this is true  they can be downloaded as PDF in audible com What would have made Start with Why better  When people think about winning they often visualize the trophies  cheering crowds and the sense of accomplishment  Sure  its all those things  But its so much more  And its not all sunshine and roses  Its gritty  unforgiving  obsessive  uncivilized  and worse Tim Grover and Shari Wenk have masterfully painted a picture of what winning is like for those who do it over and over again at the highest levels  The MJs and Kobes of the world  Two phenomenal athletes who dominated in basketball  but who also didnt accept their wins in that arena as being enough  Mr  Grover knows firsthand all that those two greats sacrificed to build their careers because he was by their side through much of it Ive been privileged to have been allowed in the Down and Dirty mentoring group since it began two years ago  During those two years my career and resilience have skyrocketed thanks to what Ive learned from Tim  Shari and the other allies in the group  This book is the distillation of those two years of mentoring  There is an incredible wealth of knowledge in this book and you would be well served to truly study it and come back to it over and over for additional listens to see how the ideas hit you differently after youve had some time to ponder them and grow  This book is very difficult to listen to because this reader often emphasizes phrases unnaturally  It sounds like she is reading cold  without rehearsal  It s very annoying  Her voice is nice  her voices are good enough  but the way she reads isn t the way people speak  Also  it s really obvious that there are words that she is unfamiliar with and has had to practice  but is still not used to saying  Those words jump out every time she reads them  I would advise reading the book not listening  The reader diminishes rather enhances the prose  UPDATE I finished the book and it was good  I really liked one of the smaller twists at the end and the big twist was GREAT considering what we are going through right now  I  for the most part  got used to the reader  This book would be a much more enjoyable listen if the reader rerecords the book  By the end her reading of previously unfamiliar words stop standing out and the reading become a bit more natural  Whether you read or listen  it s a good book  The book is amazing  the story is enthralling  and the narrator was the only thing detracting from the book Seriously  his voice wasn t great  he constantly mispronounced words  and his characters weren t distinguished from one another even if the writing was  I d pay to have someone else read this book tbh  I thought this was  He  Who Fights Monsters  not everyone talking about one thing going on for 20 chapters  The first book was amazing  but now the MC is stuck around 20 other people  who for some reason we need to hear about all of their interactions with each other  Nothing going on has to do ANYTHING with the MC  I feel like the author got lost building all of these personalities that he forgot to actually focus on the  He  that is that Main Character  I did not enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed the first book in the trilogy  this story felt as though it was Meandering far more  it was as if Brandon Sanderson was in search of a story  now  I love these books  I love the excitement I love the world  I love the magic  I love the characters  I feel forever connected to the characters in the story  the fight scenes feel as though they could have been better described in the end  mistborn is a wonderful Trilogy filled with A Beautiful World characters magic and love story  a small dip in the level of the writing is not enough to deter me from continuing my interest in this amazing trilogy  This is one of the better audiobooks on Audible  The narrator is great  and so is the story  which alternates between two protagonists  This novel won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction  and there are countless reviews  so I won t go into a summary of it  I will say that it won The Pulitzer for a reason  and the narration only enhances the story  You can t go wrong with this one Overall rating 4 72 stars I love all the Graham Hancock titles I ve read listened to so far  and having Graham narrate it is icing on the cake  He has a beautiful British accent and is a very good reader  First of all  to be clear for the skeptics  when Graham Hancock says  lost civilization   he usually means something more akin to a lost culture of advanced knowledge  which at one time or another informed many  lost civilizationS  such as the Egyptians and the Maya he doesn t believe those two cultures directly influenced each other  just that they both inherited older traditions of myth and astronomy which had been spread around the world before written history began  This is Graham s hypotheses for why many cultures attribute their knowledge of writing  agriculture  and time keeping to a previous race of  gods   they were probably referring to ancestors who had learned and passed on their great skills I m glad I read  Magicians of the Gods  first  the sort of sequel to this one  because in the 20 years between  Fingerprints  and its sequel  he s become a better writer   Fingerprints  has lengthy descriptions of travel episodes  which sometimes add character to the story  such as when he  illegally  climbed the Great Pyramid   but sometimes make the narrative slow to a crawl   Magicians  has the benefit of updated research on the possible events of the end of the last ice age  and older structures around the world which hadn t been discovered in 1995 All that said  Fingerprints put forth many ideas and hypotheses which still haven t been debunked or explained  and which I never hear from mainstream history books  As just one example  Mercator  of map projection fame  published a map in 1538 which shows a continent identical to Antarctica  in exactly the right place  Antarctica wasn t supposed to have been  discovered  until the 1800s  but Mercator s map was probably based on older source maps now lost  and Mercator wasn t the only one with such a map  Did the original maps come from the great astronomers and navigators of the Ottoman Empire  Were they passed on from the library at Alexandria  What wasn t mentioned in the book was that Mercator himself corresponded frequently with John Dee  the famous court astronomer of Elizabeth I  who took an interest in old Middle Eastern religious books and texts  many of which weren t translated into English  John Dee had the largest library in England and provided Mercator with materials  This could have been the perfect opportunity for Mercator to update his maps with what he saw as the best information available to him  Interesting stuff  and it s why Hancock s books are so popular  He doesn t need to overdramatize his material  because there is plenty to choose from  and he presents it all in a rational  questioning way The classic controversies brought up in Fingerprints  and still hot topics today  are an Ice Age dating of the Sphinx  by Schwaller de Lubicz  John Anthony West and Robert Schoch  and the Orion Correlation theory of the Giza pyramids by Robert Bauval This is a great book if you like the types of historical mysteries that have become fodder for conspiracy theories  even though Graham himself isn t an Ancient Alien theorist  and often argues against them  If you want to understand why Graham is so eschewed by older  stodgier  academic circles  start here  but you ll want to move on to what Magicians of the Gods has to offer extensive data on the Younger Dryas comet impact hypotheses  hidden pyramids in Indonesia  and an astonishing section on the advanced astronomical observations of the Sabians  a starworshipping cult in Harran  Turkey  In the academic world  this book has become wellknown and influential that a realistic estimate of its impact has the sound of hyperbole  That makes it worth reading in the same way as Plato s Republic or Machiavelli s The Prince you may not agree with all or even much of its arguments  but there s much value simply in knowing what these ideas are that so many people are thinking and talking about For those who don t know the book  it describes the connections between how European empires  and the US  somewhat  controlled the Middle East politically  fantasized about it  and studied it  arguing that these were all aspects of the same structures and processes  It suffers from a certain amount of contradiction and onesided argument  but I think that when Said was writing in the 1970s the other side of the argumentthe procolonialist sidewas more frequently heard than it is now Another reviewer complained that he quit after listening for 45 minutes and finding that it was all generic political arguments  I think that reviewer never got past the new preface  which does go on for something like 45 minutes  The preface was added around 2004 and is mainly a fairly standard critique of the US invasion of Iraq from the perspective of its early years  There s no solution but to be patient and wait for the book itself to begin I ve had a print copy for years and never got around to reading it  but am finding the audio version pleasant going  Said s writing is much clearer and jargonfree than many of his admirershe is a scholar of literature  after all  The reader does well enough to keep my attention  and handles fairly well the French words that show up regularly  There are times when he sounds exactly like a computergenerated voice reading text  but his reading doesn t put me to sleep  I teach collegiate and PhDlevel courses on behavior change  Even with that background  this book was a revelation  It efficiently synthesizes the most essentialsciencebacked insights  And the book is a delight  You really learn about what Margulies went through as a child and as an actor and how she became this incredible woman  Jill strikes a major chord with these insights  Ive heard these characters voices all my life and this context is brilliant  Taking 90 seconds and doing a brain huddle is something I can incorporate into my daily life right away  Also  recognizing which of the four is currently at the wheel for others give us an opportunity to choose how we show up for them  Very very practical stuff  Peace really is just a thought away  Thanks Jill  Good overview of the way government spending has been misguided by unfounded racial fears  A significant study and the author is not bad for a first timer ButEvery chapter so far has multiple recording hiccups  leading to unfinished sentences and incomplete thoughts  Not sure how audible assures recording quality but a book publisher would not accept poor printing  Why is audible okay with recording flaws  It seem that my whole life I was searching for the information in this book  I came upon this book by strange chance  and I m so pleased to have found it  Thank you audible for having us in your library this book has shown me so much about myself and my family structure  I absolutely recommend it  not only to those who feel that they might have emotionally immature parents  but also for those people who feel that their own partner might be suffering from emotionally immature parents  Performance only gets 3 stars because the narrator seemed to inconsistently flipflop between the  character voice  to a regular reading voice when it came to the case studies  or examples from clients  So  there s this marketing strategy in which you write a book as a leadgenerator  Under this strategy  your goal isn t to make money from the book itself  but to get broader exposure  so you can find more potential customers for the other things you sell Typically  you ll invite the reader to download some bonus content at the end  in exchange for joining your mailing list  Usually  this is fine  If I got a lot of value out of a book  I m happy to sign up  But this author missed the  get a lot of value out of the book  part  Now  I m not knocking the program itself  I think it s very good  and people I know have gotten lot of benefit out of it But the  book  is a waste of time  Here s why 1  The actual  useful content is maybe 15 pages long  and could be summarized in a few sentences   2  There isn t much detail  I didn t learn anything from the book that my friend didn t tell me when she recommended it  The author gives an overview of what to do  but includes very few examples of how to implement that  He throws in lots of testimonials  but no actual case studies to model our own practice on  3  There is a ton of filler  It s crammed with breathless descriptions of how  lifechanging  it all is  how you ll be  blown away   and how you ll live your  best life ever   but very little detail of how that will happen or what it will look like  4  The author intentionally leaves out detail to force you to sign up for the bonuses  Instead of sharing several examples of affirmations  he lists just one  then tells you to download the rest   Which requires you to join his list   The 30day transformation chapter doesn t actually include the transformation  it just tells you to download it   Which requires joining the list   Then it tells you to recruit your friends to his list Again if the bonuses were truly  supplemental   that wouldn t be a problem  But they re not  That content belongs in the book itself  Essentially  the book is a quick summary of his method  and an extended sales pitch for joining his list   And making your friends join his list  And buying the book for them  And becoming  VIP coaching client   In a free ebook  that would be fine  But in a book I paid for  it feels slimy and manipulative I love the program  but the author has completely lost my trust My recommendation Read a summary of the method   There are YouTube videos and Amazon reviews that cover all the detail you need   If you must buy the book  get it in text  so you can skim past all the filler  If you must get the audio  skip the first 90 minutes  What would have made Excellent Sheep better  One of the great things about fables is the ability to identify with characters  Lencioni makes it easy to gauge where you are in your success and or failure in building an awesome team  You will NOT be an effective leader without overcoming the 5 dysfunctions of a team  I like everything Douglas Adams writes  This is the first I read in his Hitchhiker series  I quickly read the rest  The story is grindingly slow  staggeringly predictable  and mindnumbingly boring  The prose is serviceable in most places  with the occasional bit of excellence consistently offset by exhibits of clumsiness  The moralizing is repulsively childish  while the worshipful fixation with music  women  and alleged intellectual excellence is absolutely more garbage than I could endure But yawning wider than any of these holes is the shrieking abyss of a main character  Kvothe  He s the most detestable protagonist I ve ever suffered  Astoundingly superior in every fashion and boringly tragic and brooding and snarky and brilliant  Kvothe is the most ridiculous junior high wish fulfillment selfinsert ever distilled On the bright side  the narrator is not awful  I read this book in three days and knew I needed to hear her tell it  Her music and voice are beyond comprehension as is her crazy sense of humor  If you love Brandi youll adore this book  If you dont love her yet  you will  This book is the most padded book I have ever read  It essentially says  Eat less sugar and refined carbs  Eat less processed food  Drink Apple cider vinegar in water  Exercise is good but doesn t help weight loss  Fat and coffee are good  Fast  There  I saved you 15 dollars and 15 hours of listening to the same things over and over  I loved this book  I have done a lot of reading and personal experiments over the last ten years about what the heck is going on with my stomach  This book lead me to conclude what I already thought to be true  so that is fantastic  The real triumph of this book  to me at least  is the last section where Tamara goes through all the different supplements and their true validity  Guys  The internet is FULL of people just trying to make profit  whether what they push will help or not  so it was wonderful to read  hear  about truly science backed supplements that could be useful to certain people  Awesome book   Be warned that this is a collection of ancient legends from imaginative yet martial tribal peoples  Three times 50 beautiful maidens and warriors who kill 100 men at a pass are a regular feature of such fare  but shape changing and passage to the world of the fakery folk feature as well  Gerard Doyle brings these ancient tales to life  such that youd think a hedge school master or some bard from the past were the one telling it  Yet its all based on sound scholarship  giving as much verity to myth as may be possible  Its a comprehensive work as well  starting with the earliest Roman references to the Celts and ending with Celtic influenced stories of Saints Patrick  Brigid and Brenden  I was a bit bored at first but kept on and enjoyed it  Definitely worth the read I was looking for an adventure book that my 14 year old son  11 year old and 9 year old daughters would like  This book fit the bill perfectly  We drive a lot and love to listen to books together  This one kept us on the edge of our seats  wondering what would happen next  Mr  Paulsen is a fantastic writer and we look forward to listening to the rest of the books in this series  As Im thinking more about what to do next  and what do I want my life to look like this book has been a perfect companion  Like having a friend as a sounding board  in a way  Because the author is so grounded  honest  insightful  Not a self help book in tone or content  more real  and helpful  than that  Im sure Ill keep coming back to this book again through my life  Also the narration is excellent  Ive heard the author speak on podcasts and at first thought she was narrating  Its professionally and very well narrated  but whats really unusual is how well the narrator seems to channel the essence of the way the author probably would speak these words  Thats a rare find  and makes listening to this book even better  It was pretty clear that the narrator was seeing the text for the first time as she read it and that there was insufficient editing to fix even howling errors  such as sixhundred dollars million or mispronouncing The Economist This is likely not so much the actors fault as Audibles  as the problem occurs in a lot of Audible Originals and plagues the news recordings  Audio is the medium Pronouncing words  including names  correctly and have intonation that makes sense matters a lot  Mind  Blown  Kate Stewart brought a totally different kind of read with Flock and I loved it  This review is going to be short and vague because this is a book you want to go into blind Cecelia meets Sean at her first day at work  Shes working at a place her father owns to earn her spot there  She and her father are estranged  but shes living with him and working for him for reasons bigger than herself  Shes expecting to just survive this year of working for her dad  but with Sean and his group of friends  everything changes I love books that make me think  make me feel  and keep me guessing  This one did all three  Im so glad I had no idea what this was about  Im glad I went in blind and was surprised with each twist and turn  No one crafts a story quite like Kate Stewart  and I was blown away by this one  It was on my mind for days  I couldnt stop thinking about what happened  whats happening  and what will happen next  I have so many theories This story is unique  its twisty  and its insanely sexy  After finishing book one  all I have to say is to buckle up  yall  Youre in for a ride  Im so glad these books are releasing so close together because youre not going to want to wait long for the next one  If youre looking for an epic romantic suspense  pick up Flock  Maybe my expectations were too high but I was a bit disappointed by this book  It felt like it was written over a weekend rather than something that was the result of years of deep thinking  I wish all the best for the author and Anna  his wife  since I feel like I ve gotten to know them well  Maybe that s part of the problem  It feels more like a autobiography than anything else  It feels like the author has a lot that he wants to get off his chest but he didn t think long enough about what the reader needed from a book like this  This book was full of everything I ever hope for in a book  It was super interesting  and hard to put down  Iit was funny  and I found Knight to be a person I was cheering for throughout the book as he faced one trial after another  It was a truly inspirational story  I wish everyone I know could read this bookIt was also an awesome business book  It discussed significant business challenges Nike faced throughout its journey to becoming the world leader it is today  As a business owner I was very interested to read about the number of times it seemed as though Nike may need to close down due to challenges it faced  yet each time they found a way to overcome the problem  It is an amazing story of Knights resolve to never give up  I also loved hearing about Knight s leadership style of allowing the voices of his employees to be heard  even when they ran counter to his ideas  I think this is a must read for business owners  but everyone who s heard of Nike will enjoy it too The only negative about this book is that it s not nearly long enough  I would love to hear there will be a sequel to this book  There are so many aspects that could be delved into more deeply  and with the way Knight wrote this book I know they would be just as riveting as everything in this book  This held my interest and had a few twists and turns  The main character is sympathetic and you can t help rooting for her when she is cleverly framed  but I don t want to spoil this for you  This was an enjoyable listen the reader was very  very good and added a lot  The preface provided by Tarana and Bren is critical to understanding the motivation for this books manifestation  It helps to improve your listening ear and is precisely what someone like me  a white person  must do with a book aimed at helping Blacks and POC we just need to shush up and listen  These essays offer the opportunity to feel their specific experiences as it applies to the relatability of Brens body of work  Admittedly  Bren states her research and findings apply to every one  but knew it fell short as she only relates to it as a white woman  Here she has Tarana take the lead on bringing it to the Black experience  I hope it serves precisely the group intended  Its important that we all get to benefit from Brens work  As a man reading this book  I didnt mind being referred to as Sis or being told to go buy that dress Ive been eyeballing at Target   ITS THAT GOOD Informative  narrated well  skillfully structured  full of meaningful activities  entertaining and inspirational Cancelled my daughters sweet 16 birthday party giving her a Roth IRA and this book instead Thank you Tiffany  I am a Japanese who lives in Israel so it was extremely interesting and I finished in one day  The young auther is very talented  The way she wrote this book I can draw the images of each charactors  Also I loved she put here and there Japanese words She used word  Aho  which means stupid in Kansai diarect  it is very familier to me and that makes me smile  After having listened to nearly 400 audiobooks  this is the first time I have felt it so necessary as to write a review Performance Simply put  Will Wheaton was exceptional Story I am a huge fan of Ready Player One  having listened to the audiobook nine times and having waited for the preorder of it s sequel to become accessible as if I were refreshing Walmart s website for a PS5  My desperation to read the sequel persisted while I checked every three to five minutes for the available download on the release day  When I started it  I began with no knowledge of what the plot would consist of and no expectations as to what would take place so as to not establish unfair expectations and to be able to appreciate it for whatever Ernest Cline had written it to be As the story began  I was surprised by many of the events that took place immediately following the events of the previous book  those taking place three years later  and how the gap was bridged  As more information about the O N I  was released however  I found myself beyond enthralled by the concepts explored and began debating the philosophy and ethics of such a device with my friends  Not since the game SOMA  had I been so absorbed by ideas that so profoundly questioned the subjectivity of defining  humanity    reality    pain   and evolution  Without delving too deep and spoiling those who  despite this review  elect to experience Ready Player Two for themselves  I had never been so engaged and excited about concepts regarding the future of technology  humanity  and where the lines would inevitably become blurred between the two  For eight chapters  I grew more and more in love with this novel  Then the  antagonist s   were introduced Never before had I witnessed a work of art this promising wither and die so rapidly  Eight chapters of advanced  controversial  revolutionary concepts worthy of their own novel are interrupted by the revelations that  in fact  the novel is functionally Sword Art Online  You may feel this to be an exaggeration  however you would be arguing with the author as he  himself  wrote in this book that it was an exact duplication of the events of Sword Art Online on TWO SEPARATE INSTANCES  The antagonists are 1  A diluted rehash of the previous novel s primary villain  2  An A I  who lacks any traits that would separate him from any other noteworthy  and more creative  A I  in literature such as V I K I  from IRobot or HAL 9000 from 2001 A Space Odyssey  whose motivations mirror those of antagonists from Sword Art Online  The Matrix  PsychoPass  Terminator  Tron and any other work of fiction containing such material  And 3  A perversion and retcon of the previous novel s James Halliday  a man defined by his oddities  Steve Job slike passion for his creations  and most importantly HIS GOOD INTENTIONS  Halliday was expressly stated  and clarified by our every discovery about him  to be a man who cared about his creations first and his friends closely as second despite his proclivity to push others away  He was brilliant  but tragically lost  He was adored and renowned  but ultimately completely alone  It was his nature  not his invention that lead to the formation of his legendary contest  That nature was initially consistent even in this book through his creation of the O N I as a tool of communication and his desire that it would ultimately act as the last tool humanity would ever need to understand and save one another  This bastardization or his character is reminiscent of so many other iconic figures of fiction who have been recently desecrated in the name of subversion or some other illconceived notion and I m very sad to see it happen here when James was so understandably tragic and empathetic in Ready Player One These issues are objectively and indefatigably cartoonish and insulting  I would have expected these alterations to be thought of in a parody of the original work  not its authentic sequel  If you are able to ignore the retconning of the previous novel  convince yourself that this is a natural progression of the story despite it definitively not being so  and look past the story s disregard for its own reader s intelligence or enjoyment by supplying villains that are just as likely to be found in a skull shaped lair located in a swamp plotting against the Super Friends  then this may be the book for you  To anyone who actually loved the original novel as anything more than a mindless consumer of anything nostalgic  you are likely to be disappointed  It ultimately will come down to how much you care about having a compelling narrative and antagonist in what you read  I  however  simply can not overlook a sequel killing it s predecessor just so it can stand atop its corpse and call itself tall  I read everything  Anything that comes my way  on a voracious journey to find books that make me FEEL  Once  in a great while  comes a book like this  A book I can read again and again  and the feel is always there Mr Backman is an author for our time  of our time  I cant even begin to first express my gratitude to Sarah Jakes Roberts  Thank you for beingobedient to the calling God has on your life  This book is highly recommended to every women needing a blueprint to help him revolutionize their life  The words of this book grasped at your core  challenges you deeply  Ladies its time to pick up the pieces and run for the hills  My life has been changed forever  I listened to this one directly following a conservative perspective book on diversity  I knew right away that the authors were liberals from the way they spoke about Obama  or didnt speak  vs the way they spoke about Trump  This however was the only way to know because the evidence presented was very fair  far more fair than the previous book I read with many overlapping themes  I am a conservative who really believes in the great lessons espoused in this book  We need far less antagonism and reaction on left and right if we want to remain a functional republic  I really believe this is whats best for our nation and children  Just a complete life changing audiobook  very well done  LEGENDARY  One the best books Ive ever had the pleasure of listening to  thank Robin Sharma and team  Good book  Goes deep But remember its a biography  This book has a lot of science  and its got goodies if youre curious about the technology  Even if you are interested in the history or the people  this book is a good book But the author has such a weird relationship with venture capitalists and an idea about competitive competition that he contradicts himself on so many occasions  Hes swaying a whole lot around the subject of competitiveness  The author describes open collaboration as the key to success in this case  but in the next part hes basically telling the reader that patents and money is what makes the world go round  Im not saying hes wrong  but since this is a Biography I would like to know which one it is from HER standpoint Im sorry Walter  but your own view on anything here is just slag polluting the process  Tell us what actually was important historically  not what you using your own personal frame of reference perceive to be important So which one was it  Was it her cut throat competitiveness or her collaborative collegial traits that made this breakthrough possible  Ever since I first read NEVER LET ME GO I have been a fan of Ishiguro s  running out to obtain every book of his that I could find  I was delighted when I got the news that this was out  and it was  as I noted  well worth having waited for  It has all the hallmarks I have come to appreciate plot twists galore characters with artificial intelligence who are often more human than the humans in the story an examination of some point of society s mores and excellent writing that doesn t get in the way of the story itself The reader  Sura Siu  does an excellent job  The time this took as an audiobook flew by  much to my delight Whether you are an old Ishiguro fan  or just discovering his work  I think you will enjoy this one very much  so please give it a try  I just downloaded the book and only in the first few chapters but Im already learning things that I havent heard before  I love it so far and recommend to anyone looking to get out of the rat race  Also take a look at the pdf files included with the book  In order to do so go to the desktop version of your audible account and go to library  there is where youll be able to download the PDFs The title is a bit misleading  The first part is where the gems are and where the author really talks about the differences between casual  wheredestinytakesme attitude and intentional living About 25 into the book the story starts to shift to what the author believes to be significant living  some stories about it and getting back to what should have been the book s theme  intentional living  at the end of the chapters almost in this style  Oh  and you have to be intentional to achieve this aspect of your journey towards significance  While I agree that you have to be intentional if you want to become significant  you don t have to want to be significant if you want to be intentional  And the definition of significance that is based on other people s impression of you and the way you made an impact on someone else s life    It s not really my cup of tea  I mean  I like being considered a good man and I like praise and the feeling when you help someone out or fight for a cause that you think is good  And all of those things are nice  but all of that is pretty natural to my way of thinking  And besides  what you think is really important and right might not be the same for everyone else and I found that whole significance chase to be a bit shallow and missing the point of good deeds Maybe that s the part  doing good for someone else besides him  that the author needed to figure out through his life and why this was such a big thing for him  he admits that his early actions were fueled by wrong  selfish  intentions  And that s what I wanted to say  I think the author is a natural gogetter  he s had great work ethics from the start and  as he said himself in the book  action was his first and strongest reaction  You can just tell that he never really had to struggle with being the  ideaman   procrastination and other productivity poisons  I understand the cure for procrastination and such  in actions is mostly  Get some discipline  and  Man up   but it s really not quite helpful to read listen to a book from someone who has never had to make the transition  I wanted to hear what it takes  how he did it  how other people did it  his struggles  his pain  if it was painful  and his eventual rewards and insights  I could probably compare it to a beginner to midlevel running enthusiast reading an Usain Bolt book titled  How to run  with the first half of the book being about the benefits of running and some running technique and mental cues and the other half being about how he doesn t run or train or set world records for himself  but for his team  country and people looking up to him  The techniques and benefits are rushed  because it s so natural to him that he doesn t even consider there are people who don t find it so straightforward and who didn t quite learn it when they were young  And the other part  why he runs  make for a good biography  but other than that and a few interesting insights  it s not really actionable Maybe I m dissatisfied because I was looking for a book for people who have dreams and goals  what the author calls  good intentions   but really struggle with living out those intentions and working on their dream  what the author calls  intentional living   Tim Urban s blog posts about procrastination and spending time effectively  on the projects you actually think would improve your life  fulfillment and happiness in the long term  is a better read and I would buy his book on the subject immediately The book does have a few gems and they are contained in he beginning of the book  The other part should ve just been a separate book named  My story of significance   It s a shame because I really though this book was going to be what I was looking for  a  lidlifter   as the author calls it  Turns out it wasn t going to happen with this book  maybe  hopefully  for someone else Other than that  the recording is fine  but the voice is a bit  notexciting   for a lack of a better term  and I just kind of got lost after listening to it for a while  I found the stories to be uninteresting and my thoughts would often drift  which doesn t normally happen   I reluctantly finished the book  and I have a rule of finishing the book if I thought it was worth picking up  but it really did a number to my Audiblelistening time  for better or for worse  I m always paranoid when I read reviews and see people recommending specific books and authors  thinking those are competition paid reviews  but I m just going to mention that I like Jim Rohn s material a lot better  I think it s more focused  interesting and insightful  with more powerful and deeper messages and things to consider and think about If you read this far  thank you for your patience  and if  after everything that I just wrote  you still think the book is worth your time and money  go for it and hopefully it will do for you what I d hoped it was going to do for me  Dr  Stanton  Boxset  Audiobook by T L SwanFormats Read AudiobookI Give this Book a 44 5 5 Star Rating  Listing as a High 4   Audiobook review at bottom  HEA    An

its really good  I do wish there was more angstdrama  dont know why I was craving it so much while listening to this book but I guess its because the plot is was very addictive LolSuspense 3 5 5Dark    No  No Spoilers Im still fairly new to this author  and the writing of this is so good I was pulled right into her writing immediately Im really looking forward to reading more books cause I love how theres so much depth in this book  and love the fact that this author isnt afraid of drawing out emotions with the characters  with the reader  And with a really enjoyable HEA  Seriously Well Done Audiobook ReviewOverall 44 5 5  Listing as 4 Story 44 5 5Performance 44 5 5Narrator Elena Wolfe  Stephen DexterIve never listened to a book narrated by Stephen Dexter before  and good gracious where the heck have I been   This man has a gorgeous voice  And will immediately be listening to more books narrated by him  he did a great job narrating Cameron and everyone else in his POV Elena Wolfe is one of my favorite narrators  Without looking at who were narrating this  when I immediately heard Ashleys POV I KNEW immediately who was narrating cause her voice is so identifiable and it was so easy to listen to her and I did enjoy her narration of other characters as well   If this is your first foray into the history of pirates  I heartily recommend listening to The Republic of Pirates by Colin Woodard first  It s a much more engaging read  and the narrator does a MUCH better job  I swear  this narrator almost managed to make PIRATES seem boring with his delivery   After you read that book  if you re still hungry for more  than this volume is a respectable one for supplementing your knowledge  The author does present interesting history that The Republic of Pirates glossed over  including a few interesting figures left out of that other book entirely  This book just has a slightly narrower focus that I think makes it less suitable as a first book on the subject  By all means read and enjoy it  narrator aside  I certainly did   just not as your first sojourn into the subject matter  I enjoyed this book because it was fun  light  reading   I even learned or remembered a few things from Greek mythology  My 9 year old lost interest quickly  so I recommend it for maybe 1314 yr olds  I do think the narrator used some strange interpretations of voices  Some of the characters sounded absolutely the same  which left me wondering if they are the same person but I won t find that out until later   or he has a limited number of voices period  I will definitely download the next book in the series  I think if you like the Harry Potter series  you will probably enjoy these  I just finished listening to A Life on Our Planet My Witness Statement and a Vision for the Future  and then promptly watched the 1 1 2 hour companion documentary on Netflix  Listening to or reading the book is well worth the effort  At 93 and having circled the globe many times over  Sir David Attenboroughs engaging witness statement of mans changes to our environment is very powerful  He narrates  through his life story  how he has witnessed all of our earth systems  ocean  land and animals  changed by us over time  and not for the better   These earth systems are explained in a clear  understandable and succinct manner  how we have damaged them and how we can fix things  concluding with a hopeful vision for the future  The research behind all of this is blended into the story  the story of our earth  This book SHOULD be required reading for everyone The documentary is a more visual illustration of his message  perhaps an abridged version of the book  But dont just watch the documentary  The book is so well written and engaging and succinct but says so much  Both are worth the time  they complement each other  Good idea  but can be shared in like 20 minutes max  this book is too long and filled with air in my opinion  Wonderfully simple  practical concepts that provide us truly effective methods of expressing and receiving love  Any and all relationships could benefit from the information contained in this book  While it is written from a Christian perspective and focuses almost exclusively on married couples experiencing some level of dysfunction in their marriages  the material can be interpreted in any way that best serves your needs  I myself am not a Christian nor am I married  but this has offered wonderful clarity and help to me and my significant other as we cocreate the relationship of our dreams together  Hoping to put these lessons to use to set us up for success so we won t need the damage control down the road  Spent ten hours on a ladder painting walls  This outstanding production of a quickly paced mystery  set in a nearby small town in Texas  made the mundane task so enjoyable  The pacing and the twists kept me guessing until the end othe bookI still have more painting to do  I don t usually write reviews but I felt very compelled to after listening to this book  I first read Twilight as a teenager in highschool before the movies came out  Coming back to this story as a fully grown adult I was expecting the same  love concurs all  teen romance  While it is still very much that  I ve found this version of Twilight to have so much more depth  I know this is partially due to to receiving the same story from a different perspective as well as Edward being a much more mature  though still flawed  character  But I also feel like Stephenie Meyer s writing has matured so beautifully as well I have very much enjoyed Edward s point of view and it really helped flesh out the decisions he made in this story  I also love receiving more history of Cullens in general  It was great to receive so many more details about these vampires which made them feel so much more grounded and ironically  human  I m happy with all of the changes Stephenie added in  like Bella actually naming the album Phil gave her as well as naming her favorite songs  I liked getting to know Bella through Edward s perspective too  much more than I thought I would  However I could possibly attribute that to relating much more to Edward this time around as opposed to when I was a teenager and very much related to Bella As for the narration of this book    WOW  Easily one of the BEST performances I have listened to in a LONG time  I had to do a quick search of Jake Abel and after realizing he was an actor  his performance made so much more sense  The emotions that he is able to convey are fantastic and feel utterly real and raw  Jake Able PREFORMED this book  he didn t merely read it  His female voices aren t annoying either  I find males usually have more trouble with pleasing female voices than the other way around so this was also a very large bonus  I hope he continues to narrate audio books and I suggest you listen to this book if for no other reason than to hear this performance  EDIT  I m throwing in an edit here to clarify this narration review  I think the performance is great for Edward  Real emotion is put into his words  No  there isn t a huge variety of character voices in this narration but I don t think it s needed  The story is told through Edward s perspective and to me  that s the most important part  Everyone else that s speaking is distinguishable enough from Edward that you know it s someone else  If the POV was different  like 3rd person  then I d have different feelings   END EDIT In conclusion  I hope that Stephenie continues on to write the rest of the Twilight Saga from Edward s point of view  I have been recaptured by this love story and I want to follow it to it s conclusion via this perspective  Please give it a listen  It is more than deserving of your time  I actually really enjoyed this book  I just dont really know why   Good points Its a totally different take on the whole paranormal romance vampire  werewolf  zombie idea  I enjoyed it wasnt just in your face vampire and werewolf  There are different names associated with them that bring them out of the eye rolling same old story  The idea of the story is new and not just a rehash or one different love triangle or another I enjoyed that the main character isnt a useless fawn but also isnt all balls up  I liked the secondary characters Bad points I HATED the fact that there is abuse  Not only that there is abuse but the author makes you live through it  Not ok  TRIGGERS  I dont think I like the male lead  Its not even the whole good guy bad guy good guy thing  Its not the betrayal  Its not lies or anything like that  It just honestly feels like he is playing her through the entire book  I dont buy the love  The whole idea that she is the most important thing to the whole nation but no one ever checks on her from the palace  If she is going to save the whole of everything forever then maybe see if her keeper is beating the hell out of her maybe once I dont mentally understand how someone who lived such a sheltered life  doesnt really have family who loves her  is abused by her overseers  isnt really allowed to socialize  and who is basically kept in a closet her entire life can be a strong independent person  Thats not how it works Am I going to get the second book  Yes  most likely  I want to see where the story goes  Am I going to have this books on my list of books I listen to time and time again  Nope  This is my favorite science fiction series  The characters are easy to identify with  and you will find yourself sucked into this imaginary universe  nicknamed the Enderverse by fans Recommended order of reading  in my opinion  Ender s Game  Ender s Shadow  Shadow of the Hegemon  Shadow Puppets  Shadow of the Giant  Speaker for the Dead  Xenocide  Children of the Mind  Reading the books in this order will keep you interested and keep the story moving more naturally If after reading all of these wonderful books you are still itching for an Enderverse fix then read First Meetings  The list above is sorted by the Enderverse timeline  Meaning that the flow of events in the stories are uninterrupted  If you were to read the books in the order they were published  you would bounce back and forth in between time and few of the plot twists in future books would be revealed before you wanted them to be known  First Meetings  however contains short stories that occur both before and in between the list above within the Enderverse  Lord Graves tries to survive with his favorite mortals  and crow  after living through the fallout Seattle and the start of the of the apocalypse  they battle through new nightmares and find out why it was started in the first place  Awesome sequel This was another amazing story by Louise Bay  Its the kind of book you finish in a day because you just dont want to put it down  And with great main characters like Gabriel and Autumn  it makes perfect sense why its hard to stop reading  Gabriel was a loving  attentive father who makes his daughter his number one priority  He was hurt by his wife walking out on him and their child years ago so was determined to only focus on providing for his daughter and spending time with her  But even that gives a good idea of what a good guy he is  He fought his feelings for Autumn but it was a losing battle  She was so fun and upbeat and really just exactly what he needed  The secondary characters were also fantastic  Not only did I love seeing more of the characters I loved from previous Louise Bay books  but Im also excited for whats to come  Gabriel still has a few single friends and I cant wait to see them meet their matches  The characters overall were probably my favorite part of this book  There were several different personalities  and even the one that I thought I had pegged turned out to have more going on then I expected  This was just an excellent book that I would highly recommend to fellow contemporary fans  Especially those who like a good British hero Narration on this one is perfection  I love Shane East and Andi Arndt so I had not hesitation when I saw them as narrators when it came to spending the credit on this  They did not disappoint  I loved listening to them and the way they really brought the story to life  What an amazing book  I got 2 hours of sleep last night because I couldn t stop listening  This is a very powerful book about strength  courage and prevailing  I am one of those people who see someone going through something and think why don t you just walk away or why let things happen to you   this book made me understand that it s not always so black and white  I always admit that I have no empathy for people  it s just not part of who I am I guess   I think with my brain not my heart most of the time and for the 1st time I honestly feel like I see that it s not always so easy to see things as right or wrong  good and bad or cut and dry  for the first time I actually see the grey area and completely understand it  Seeing what I ve been ignorant too all my life is breaking my heart now  I wish I could go back to all the times I listened to people and treated their problems like they were easy to fix and tell them I m sorry and that I wish I would have been a better listener  a better friend and more helpful to them when they needed me most Colleen Hoover is an amazing author and always seems to write a story that makes you fall in love with the characters no matter what faults or issues they have and she did it again with this book  I think I ll be thinking about this one for a very long time The characters in this book were all so likable and have so much depth and so many layers  That is part of what I loved so much about this book  even when I wanted to hate a character I just couldn t The narration is good but it took me a little while to get used to her male voices  After an hours at most I didn t even remember what I didn t like about the narration in the beginning  The Stand is one of my favorites novels of all times  I absolutely love this tale of epic proportions written by the amazing Bestselling and Awardwinning author Stephen King If you pick up The Stand you ll be pulled into a world filled with lifelike characters  vivid descriptions and unsettling events  Weaving drama with fantasy and paranormal  the author manages to deliver a riveting story that will delight generations of readers and listeners The audiobook version of The Stand by Stephen King is brought to life in a stellar performance by Grover Gardner  an acclaimed narrator with a lot of prestigious awards to his name  Mr  Gardner is the perfect choice for this adventure in which the forces of Good and Evil faceoff and make their Stand in an unforgettable battle With such a talented narrator at the helm  this audio production is the perfect example for why audiobooks are better than regular books  Although the almost 48 hours duration might seem a daunting endeavour for some listeners  you ll breeze through it without keeping track of time  Trust me  I listened to it twice  so far   No words on paper can be more alive than a heartfelt performance   The Stand is one of the best and most immersive narrative experiences that I listened to and I listened to more than 1 200 of them    Trust me  this is a book you ll never forget If you liked this review please vote Helpful below and find more of them here and on theAudiobookBlog I also post honest reviews at the author  narrator  or publisher s request  you can get in touch with me for more details Thank you  stay safe Victor One of my favourite books read the way I d like to be able to  Rob Inglis does this story the justice it deserves  This book is the second of three  you ll want the other two  The reviews from last year that indicate this book is out of order no longer apply  The chapters of the two books are in the right order  followed by Tolkien s appendices that include extra info  Without this content  these books are much shorter than the previous ones in the series  I especially appreciated these after I finished the saga for the very first time  I signed up especially for Audible to finish the auiodbooks as read by Inglis  His voice is very charming  and I love that he sings all of the songs and performs voices of each of the characters  Storywise  I was familiar from seeing the movies  The book includes more details regarding the Hobbits after their return to the Shire although  I might suggest readers bookmark a map of Middle Earth to reference when listening to minimize confusion  It might be easier to follow the battles when reading rather than listening  This was still quite an enjoyable read and a great way to wrap up an epic story  Lets face it  money is a complex and  at times  bewildering subject  Theres so much contradictory information out there  It can be quite overwhelming to hear all of that info and try to make sense of it  based on our own situations Rather than try to provide another set of socalled cant lose strategies for managing money  here  Housel seeks to show readers that success with money is a soft skill filled with lots of nuances  Though that may sound daunting at first  I can assure you he doesnt just leave readers out to dry  No  instead  he provides countless new ways of thinking about money that allow readers to see their financial situations in new lights Sure  that may also sound a bit nebulous on the surface  but trust me  it will all make sense if when you pick this one up  Some of those new ways of looking at money include ideas such as different peoples life experiences lead to vastly different views about money the hardest financial skill to acquire is to learn to stop moving the goalposts and eventually become content with what we have and protecting the downside is probably the most important thing when it comes to managing money properly Housel applies these somewhat abstract concepts through the use of countless stories and examples  which makes the digestion of them so much more straightforward  In the end  were left with a core set of principles for managing our money moving forward  And  spoiler alert  so much of that managing boils down to effective financial psychology  the very subject of the title of this book I think most readers will enjoy it quite thoroughly  and  as such  I recommend it highly Brian SachettaAuthor of Get Out of Your Head Let me start by saying I am a fan of Essentialism  Though the advice in this book is good  the concepts are not original  If you ve devoted time to adopting a productivity system the concepts and themes in Effortless will likely not be new or groundbreaking  This book is a mishmash of productivity classics such as Checklist Manifesto  7 Habits  GTD and Getting Results the Agile Way with the addition of entertaining short stories and amusing historical references  If you are looking to go beyond being entertained to actually enhancing your productivity this book is not for you  Elizabeth Norton has compiled a fascinating account of what life as a woman must have been like during the Tudor period in England  I listened to this book over several days  often rewinding just to hear parts again because it was so interesting  She speaks with astonishing detail about everything in women s lives  from birth to death  making a distant time seem very real to me  I have always found British history fun to learn about  but discovering this wellnarrated account of what daily life for women was like during this time was very satisfying   I really recommend this book as a wonderful addition to information about this time  Please for the love of God  I need book three and four out on audible ASAP  I m I m love with series  In the first book  The Way of Kings  we were introduced to the world of Roshar  It is a world of magic and aliens where hurricanelike storms lay savage to the world every few days and all of its inhabitants must adapt their lives accordingly  It is a world at war between the human armies led by High prince Dalinar Kholin and the Parshendi  a humanoid species  We were introduced to Jasnah  who is a renowned scholar and the niece of the High Prince Dalinar Kholin  her student Shallan  and Kaladin  a slave that by the end of Way of Kings is beginning to become the worlds first Knights Radiance in centuries If you havent read listened to The Way of Kings  I would strongly recommend that you do before going on to this second book  Words of Radiance  If you have read listened to the first book I would recommend a review of TWOK before going on since it has been over four years and the second book starts off right where The Way of Kings  left off At 48 hours and 15 minutes this is a long book  in fact Brandon Sanderson posted on his blog that he wrote the manuscript under the working title the Book of Endless Pages  He was referring to the endless learning set forth in his first book but it seemed appropriate given its length but dont let the length of this book deter you as I listened the hours seemed to fly past  This is an amazing book Word of Radiance focuses on four characters Kaladin  Shallan  Dalinar  and Adolin  In TWOK Kaladin was the main character and is still very prevalent but this book reveals more about Shallan  Like The Way of Kings  Sanderson interlaces the present with the past  developing the background on the main characters while moving the plot forward This is only book two in a ten part series and even though I cant wait for the next book I found the ending satisfactory I word about the narrators  Ive always been a big fan of Michael Kramer and Kate Reading and I thought they gave another great performance  With President Nelsons unexpected death  Nick Cappuano has suddenly become the President  State of Affairs focuses on how the Cappuanos are navigating this new chapter of their lives amid the chaos I enjoyed seeing the Cappuanos navigating this significant life change and settling into the White House with the help of their friends and family  Old and new characters intermingle for this best of both worlds start to the new series  Amid all of the chaos  Sam and Nick work together to make sure they remain focused on what s important to them Narrator Eva Kaminsky does an excellent job  She deftly voices Sams uncertainty and determination to do it all  be a wife  mom  homicide detective  and First Lady With this entertaining  fast paced story  the First Family series is off to a great start  I went into this book with huge expectations since the first one was so flawless  However  it blew any expectations I had right out of the water Its a beautiful continuation to the first book  yet its nothing like it There were genuine moments where I was gripping the end of my chair in fear and Hoping against hope  I did not feel this connected to a book in a long time  MR  Green does a great job thrusting the listener into the characters mind  Listening I could feel his frustration as if it was mine  their anger as if my blood was boiling  and I felt their fear so greatly that my heart was pounding  The narrators also do a job here This is overall an amazing book  I would recommend it  Kept me guessing until the very end  I love the narration  Keep them coming  More  I had my doubts about reading this book  I have a hard time with books about WWII Germany  I knew this would probably be a heartbreaker too but for some reason I decided to take it on  Maybe because the book was about books  and I usually like that genre maybe because the reviews were so good certainly not because I read it was appropriate for  sophisticated teens and adults   For whatever reason  I am glad I selected The Book Thief  It was incredibly wellwritten  The characters completely came to life  While there certainly was heartbrake  the heartwarming more than made up for it  This is a book for all ages  The narrator was outstanding and all and all  it was a book I will not soon forget  This books is necessary  It will be the second most important book you read this year following the Bible Something is shifting beneath our feet  whether you have sensed it already or not  This book accurately uses the metaphor of a fault line and earthquakes throughout  This is much of what I have felt over the last few years  Maybe you have felt it too but didnt have words to label what was happening  Or maybe you do already know something about critical race theory and intersectionality  but you see it as just a tool and you are wondering why some are making such a fuss This book will explain all of that and more I am so grateful for Brother Voddie for having written this book and made it available through so many mediums  It is well researched and explained and written with lay people in mind My only complaint is that Brother Voddie does not read his own books himself  What a voice  No other reader can do it justice as well as an author can do for their own words and his voice in particular is a favorite to listen to  Much like RC Sproul  when he teaches its like sitting with a favorite uncle as he makes things plain to understand Please buy this book  So interesting that I had to listen nonstop  We must secure our elections now  The truth will be revealed  I started with 10X Rule and just finished Sell or Be Sold  Great book for sales and I love the aggressive unapologetic approach  Grant s philosophy starts to sink in quickly and really makes you think  I have a few of Pastor Craig s books  I think this one is my favorite  I m a counselor trying to teach these same principles to my clients and want to do it in a Biblically sound way  This book is going to become one of my  go tos   Powerful and Biblical  Someday I would love to have lunch with this amazing couple  This book basically exploits your desire to read about extremely competent people  and you ll love it  Books like this are probably so entertaining because there is so much mediocrity in our own lives  It is refreshing to read about someone who apparently suffers from no mere human limitations It s a nice complement to Walter Issacson s Steve Jobs  In both  you will read about how an asshole with vision can create wonderful things by brute forcing his way through the inconveniences of reality  Both are fantastic books  but Issacson is the better journalist  Vance is so enamoured with his subject that you find him deflecting criticisms of Musk  He comes off as a bit of a fanboy  but you will forgive him  because it is so much fun to be a fanboy to Musk The heart of the book is the story of 2008  when both SpaceX and Tesla nearly went bankrupt  It s gripping I couldn t press stop till I finished that section and so was stuck awake in my bed till 100am The book offers some genuine insights one good engineer working constant overtime can achieve as much as eleven engineers trying to coordinate with each other  That s how you achieve truly great  new things  Good for them  Personally  I m happy to listen to audiobooks while tending the garden  and so I ll have to accept that Vance won t write a book about me  For sure  this is a really good story and well worth your time  But I have to say that it didn t quite live up to the sky high expectations that I had after reading all the glowing reviews  To everyone who rated this as their best listen of the year  I suggest  Dying to be Me  by Anita Moorjani  Being Mortal by Atul Gawande  and The Emperor of All Maladies by Siddhartha Mukherjee  a Pulitzer Prize Winner   The first two in particular have much in common with  When Breath Becomes air   but in my opinion are clearly more compelling  All three are must read five star books if you really liked  When Breath Becomes air   The author wants to ruin the entire foundation of marriage in the United States by propagating her ideas  We already have 53 divorce rate  In this book you will learn to see your love for your spouse and your sexual desire at the opposite sides of the spectrum with no way to reconcile them together  And her subtle solution is to seek desires outside or keep one s spouse as an outsider  She will teach you that you can t have it within your marriage  This book is a prescription for disaster  Ruin the marriage  and you ruin the society  I recommend John Gottman instead  He had a number of great books backed up by research  This book is amazing  Best purchase of 2016 hands down  I am the happiest person I know and this book made me even happier    A compilation of life lessons from two of the worlds top spiritual leaders  who combined  have over 160 years of life  Despite the fact that they represent perspectives of two different religions  they compliment each other beautifully  Both leaders come from extremely violent environments    yet exude love and compassion without exception  Tutu prayed for the oppressors in South Africa and the Dalai Lama found beauty in being exiled from his home for over 50 years now  Read this book and any problems you think you have  any anger you hold towards others  will be calmed  Both leaders end with meditations and prayers to improve your life as well as the life of those around you  Buy this book    I m about to listen to it again    The Sandman is a fantastic  immersive and unparalleled audio production  From awardwinning author Neil Gaiman and adapted for Audible by the great Dirk Maggs  you ll be swapped away in an Epic adventure you could have never imagined Expertly combining  fantasy and fiction  horror and humor  comedy and tragedy  The Sandman is a fast paced  visceral narrative experience that will stay with you for a long time Put on your headphones or even better  stream it on your favorite smart speaker in the house and you ll be in for a treat  I listened to The Sandman on my Apple Homepod Stereo setup and the experience was absolutely incredible  I closed my eyes and vividly lived all the events portrayed in this adaptation of the first three Sandman novels With a formidable cast of characters  brought to life by some of the best actors in the audiobooks and movies industries  the listener s experience is enriched and elevated by a a moving soundtrack and high quality sound effects I didn t know anything about the Sandman comics  but I was immediately blown away by this adaptation  I can t wait for the next one  This is the best Audible Original that I listened to so far If you liked this review please vote Helpful below and find more of them here and on theAudiobookBlog I also post honest reviews at the author  narrator  or publisher s request  you can get in touch with me for more details Thank you  stay safe Victor Cant help but laugh out loud listening to this awesome books  I hope someday we get more of these two   Have you ever had someone tell you a story about something interesting and then instead of telling you about the interesting thing  they spin about inane details like it was in May  no June  wait  maybe it was winter  No had to be April  3rd  Gosh  25th  That cant be right because the azaleas werent blooming    and youre like WILL YOU GET TO THE PART WHERE YOU FOUND 20   Thats this book Thats this whole series The story is really good  But for some reason its hidden behind painfully redundant conversations and inner monologues  And its hidden well  The subject matter was excellent and well researched I was fascinated with the stories of these women and their contributions to the space program That being said  I agree with several other reviewers who noted that is hard to fully engage with these women s stories because of the way the information is presented  It more like a documentary than a personal account  so you don t feel a personal connection with these fascinating ladies  Also  the author jumps around frequently  which doesn t help with the story presentation  I listened to this on audio  but I think that the movie may help with the emotional connection  I probably will see the movie at some point  now that I have this background While this is a story about the contributions of the Black women  these women also helped other women  regardless of their race  with their careers  which is also noteworthy  Even today  there are stories about companies having trouble recruiting women for the STEM fields without these women s contributions  there would be even fewer women in these fields today It is astounding to think of the trust that everyone had to place in the calculations of these human computers  Lives depended on their accuracy  and they certainly came through  It is worth noting that it took some time to get used to the use of the term  computers  to refer to people instead of machines There was a great quote in this book  The best thing about breaking a barrier is that it won t have to be broken again   I love that quote and what it represents  There was another important observation in this book near the end  and that was when the author brings out that these women do not want to stand out for their differences  but their talents and that is as it should be  Started following Jeff Berwick while researching trends and the actual plan unfolding behind the scenes Jeff is by far the closest I have

of my net worth in income taxes  it became painfully obvious that simply increasing my net worth contributions will automatically reduce my income taxes and therefore burn down this 40 ratio from both ends I guess I always knew all this  but apparently I needed this great book to tell me knowing but not doing is just as bad as not knowing at all  So if you say to yourself  I already know most of this stuff   then look around and ask yourself  Am I the Millionaire Next Door    Gates deserves credit for aiming to reach a broad audience to further the goal of mitigating a climate disaster  He s the first to point out he s an imperfect messenger with one petty exception that I ll discuss below  I kept an open mind  I appreciated Gates  insights and learned a few things  That said  such a vast undertaking in an easy to read book is bound to have shortcomings Gates urges us to focus more on the positives  realizing he can t make everyone happy  So let me try to phrase my criticism below constructively  Before I head into the criticism  Wheaton does a great job reading the book  Also  the book is inspiring  which I gather is the whole point of it  Personally  as I was listening  I had an idea that could be useful in advancing the cause  if only by a tiny bit  and be reasonably easy to implement I ll mention it at the end  If others are inspired and take on tasks  small and large  the book was worth writing While Gates had a small business startup that serves small business  he quickly grew it into a big business  His foundation interacts with governments  While that is helpful in understanding complexities on a global level  we must make sure we don t lose sight of the needs of small business if we want his policy ideas to work  He proposes an array of policies and incentives  We must remember that red tape  which is the ugly cousin of policy  increases not only cost  but also barrier to entry  it stifles innovation  The US has a more dynamic economy than Europe because it is less regulated  The shale revolution that lead the US to energy independence came about because of it you may think shale is part of the problem  and to an extent it is  but Gates rightfully points out that some of the technologies developed for it may well be part of the solution  I m not arguing we don t need government policy  But what we need is to have as many stakeholders as possible on the table  When Gates proposes labeling of goods according to the carbon footprint  we all get that in theory this may be a very helpful stepping stone  But how do we implement that without driving smaller suppliers out of business Gates mentions a carbon tax and or cap and trade as a crucial part of providing  incentives   The theory of this clear tax carbons  provide incentives to get fewer of them  Gates almost entirely sidesteps the political dimension of this  presumably in part because  well  he doesn t want to be too political  But we must tackle the political dimension if this isn t supposed to be yet another book that will make those agreeing with Gates feel good  but have rather limited impact  It is crucial to build broad bipartisan support on any policy for many reasons Gates references  but he leaves it up to the reader to connect the dots If policy is passed  who stops the next government to reverse it  In an age of hyperpartisanship it s not easy  A carbon tax is one of the few ways government can raise large amounts of money understandably  those opposing it suggest it gives government a license to spend  to build ever larger governments  Even if you don t agree to this  that s how many people think  We must square this circle if we can  many of the other challenges presented in the book become solvable  That s because an economy adjusts to  incentives  and the moment you start taxing carbon  people will find ways to use less of it the less you micromanage it  the more innovation will strive  Alas  the taxing part is a huge deal Gates mentions international trade agreements may need to be renegotiated if we want to make sure stuff we import is also to some sort of  incentive   carbon penalty  to be less carbon intensive  Anyone who has followed trade negotiations knows these are complex topics  I wish Gates had spent a little more time on this subject  I don t recall him mentioning once that the very foundation of trade  WTO  needs to be rethought  If the US were to impose import tariffs based on carbon  it would likely violate WTO rules retaliatory tariffs would be imposed  everyone loses  unless one has the attitude that less trade is better for purposes of this review  let s agree with Gates  premise that global growth is a good thing  we need to figure out how to do this without wrecking the planet   Gates sounds almost Trumpian by suggesting if you want to trade with us  you ve got to play by our rules on carbon it may need someone like a green Trump to break and rebuild the WTO  Try to square that circle with the aforementioned call for bipartisanship  Trade is immensely important Let me wrap this up by mentioning a personal idea  not in the belief that this will solve the climate crisis  but if everyone is motivated to share an idea  it increases the odds really good ones make it to the market let s encourage weather apps to not only show sun  clouds  rain  wind  but also metrics on the carbon footprint of energy consumption for the local community based on time of day  I m writing this from California where energy used during peak hours turns from green to brown  Most in California have heard calls to take this into account when they run an appliance  but if this was available on your favorite weather app  I would think there would not only be greater awareness  but usage patterns would also change  Companies like Google should be able to estimate such data already based on a variety of sources  then republish them in a standard format  so that apps can tap into them  If the idea takes off  there can be push to provide more standardized data by utility companies  making the data a firm like Google republishes more accurate meaningful  And once an API is built  this isn t just useful for consumers on their weather app  but can help industrial use  In addition to consumers  many businesses pay electricity rates based on time of day  There s really little reason why this can t be more refined  I m not suggesting different pricing based on each minute of the day  but if businesses had access to an API that suggested when exactly the energy is greenest  they can adjust their usage  Not all businesses  of course  My personal experience is with a well pump that feeds water into storage tanks the water is used to irrigate agricultural land  The pump used to run whenever the water tank level fell below a threshold  A while ago  I added a 5 chip with simple programming the pump now gives priority to the off hours  unless water tank levels fall below a certain threshold  okay  that sensor was more than 5  it would be simple enough to tap into an API that prioritizes based on how green the energy is off the grid  Such approaches have further benefits in my example  because we added sensors  we learned about water leaks at times weeks earlier than we would have otherwise  further saving not just water  but the need to run the water pump  I mention this example not because I think my 15hp water pump will save the planet  but to illustrate that simple ideas could have a wide range of applications  and those add up I gave this review the title  be curious  not furious  because a undertaking such as Gates  gives plenty of reasons to disagree with specifics  I have several as I read the book  However  I agree with Gates that we should focus on where we agree  and find ways to execute those ideas p s  as mentioned in the beginning  I can t help but raise one criticism in the introduction  Gates references that we might have to limit access to power to only essential services during an emergency  The reference to  essential  in my humble opinion is unfortunate  He likely wrote it before covid  I couldn t help but cringe  as it suggests Gates may not be able to relate to the tremendous hardship imposed on so many during the pandemic as they weren t considered essential workers  I trust Gates meant well  but as the pandemic showed  who and what is essential is in the eye of politicians that appear to rule on an ad hoc basis rather than a well thought out master plan in which many stakeholders were on the table  this book did an amazing job of bridging the intersection between ADHD and genderbased psychology  This book focuses heavily on the impact of those two dimensions on selfimage and selfesteem  It uses solid CBT frames to gently but effective nudge readers along a path of change  As the husband of a woman with ADHD this helps me be a more supportive ally  As a clinical psychologist  I found this book helpful for working with my female clients facing sexism and the impacted of ADHD  Well Done  I didnt realize it was so scripture based  it was ok  Im a believer but too much for me  needed a little more unfiltered This was a cute story  I enjoyed it  Not my favorite of Melanie Harlows  It worth the read credit  Narration it good  Normally  no matter good or bad a book may be  I HAVE to finish it  I have to know how it ends  This book is the exception  It s not so much to do with the Author  but the Narrator  James Franco s narration of the book makes this story virtually unbearable  Honestly  I couldn t even get past the first hour  I ll have to see if there s another narrator for the book  I give it 3 5 stars  After purchasing the book  you are given a code to take the emotional intelligence appraisal test online  You rate yourself on a list of statements  like whether you can be counted on  handle stress well  get along with others  and handle conflict effectively  Then based on your responses  you are directed to certain strategies in the book  like practice the art of listening and catch the mood of the room  This is ineffective  Most people can t objectively rate their own behaviors and performance  If you know you are weak in certain areas  selfawareness  selfmanagement  social awareness  and relationship management   you can practice the strategies in those chapters  However  if you are already aware of your weaknesses and want to improve  you re probably not deficient in emotional intelligence  You re better off selecting a book focused in the area you want to strengthen  such as communication  giving feedback  reading body language  building relationships  making conversations  etc Also  the book doesn t provide good illustrative examples where you can picture yourself in those situations and whether you re demonstrating emotional intelligence or not  The examples read like generic performance reviews   she sometimes comes across as defensive or aggressive  So for her to be more aware of her tone and language would be helpful   There s no context for these statements  like what was said that sounded defensive and what would have been a better alternative  I dont know if I should be admitting this but I am  this was my first Maya Angelou book  I mean  I remember reading this book in early grade school but as a child I could have never grasped the meaning  Reading this story now as an adult I appreciate her honesty  Her narrative tone placed me by her side  I walked with her  laughed with her  hurt with her  and hugged her  This story took me to the place when I questioned my placement in the world and my natural beauty  I applaud Maya Angelou for being ever so brave to share her story  This story has encouraged me to always remain true to myself  seek the guidence of the Lord   and never never lose my faith  Thank you for writing this story  I love this book  So many golden nuggets and practical applications in daily life  I know I have to re read this book very soon I love self help books  and this book stands out from the crowd in a grand way for me  I m not sure it it s the timing where I am in my life or if it s simply the book itself  that s up to you  However the practical steps in the end of every chapter and topic is in itself priceless  One example for the beginning of the book that I immediately took to heart is How can you live with people and not understand how they thing and feel    This is so interesting to think about and the author carries on to think about two different persons that you know  think about the most successful one and the least success if one  Compare them what do the they do differently  What can you learn from this I was almost afraid to carry on reading sometimes because I felt the limitless potential of myself I would like to finish this review with citing the book from my head  nothing beats seeing yourself grow to be more successful  Nothing is more challenging to try and make the best out of one self With that said  I hope you are trying your best in everything you do  If not read this book and try again Thanks to Tim ferris and also IBM  Internet business mastery  podcast for recommending this book  I owe you  Im not an entrepreneur  but I am a woman and an executive leader of a 20mil nonprofit  Rachel called me out in Chapter 1 on my nonsense money story  that was just the beginning of her telling me the truth and I am so here for it  I may not run my own business but I know I will use Rachels thought work and Million Dollar Behavior to help guide my executive leadership decisions  Ive now bought multiple copies of the hardcover version for some women in my life who I know could benefit from Rachels message  There were just too many tests and checklists in this book for it to be a descent audio book  The information is good  but much better suited to a real book to get the most out of it  I love this book  As a black women and conservative  I find this audiobook highly fascinating  thought provoking  meticulously well spoken  Far too often black women voters are a forgone conclusion  When ladies  such as Candace and myself speak out about these issues  we are suppressed  bullied and threatened  It is time that more black women garner the courage to speak out and demand that our needs are met both interracially and intraracially  This work is a reference to Ray Dalio s principals  a brief history of how he created them to get where he is now I throughly enjoyed the first 5 hours of this book  Most everything after seemed redundant  So much so  that Ray often sites the same example for the same points over and over again  These instances took value away from this book s readability and message This book is not very clear that it serves as more of a reference and that it is intended to be two reference volumes combined  Albeit  the title s subscript mentions Work  Life  This work reads more like a dictionary after you remove the first few hours of Dalio s life story Besides your ability to create a drinking game from the number of times Ray states   Ideameritocracy    Radical Truthfulness    Believability    each time he retells you about starting Bridgewater  you will find helpful advice on this book  I have listed general themes belowRay could ve summarized this book into less than a 10 hr read and kept the same quality in the 16 hr behemoth of reiderations  See my recommendation on his YouTube video below  30 min OverallThis book poses interesting ideas on how to improve life and business results  Obviously Bridgewater stands as a shining example of the success from Ray s points  I find that this melds well with Thinking Fast  Thinking Slow as well as many other jobs on how we think and make decisions  It makes our circle of knowledge a little bit wider on how to meet our goals be successful  I am not sure I would recommend this book  but I believe it does actively challenge you to improve yourself and your processes in life and business What to take awayPrinciples are useful for helping us get what we want out of life  They help guide us to meet our goals  You could argue they are algorithms that make us the best we want to be when we follow them We can use a 5 step plan to adjust our learn from our mistakes and become better  thus updating ourselves or our Principles It s best to write these principles down It s best to take the opinion of the whole to make decisions  rather than to think your opinion holds more weight  Seek out experts that are more  Believable  than you and weight their advice higher in their strengths Ray s YouTube videos are a greater  FREE synopsis of this book that cuts everything down to 30 minutes  I d highly recommend reviewing that first of you re interested in this book  The Eye of the World kicks off Robert Jordan s epic fantasy series and it is a step that should not be taken lightly  This first book is excellent and will likely have you listening to the next book in the journey before you know it  This is a long series  13 books  and each book so far is between 2341 hours of listening in unabridged format Some things you should know before you start1  Robert Jordan did not live long enough to finish the story  but he did pass along his vision for the conclusion to Brandon Sanderson who is writing the final books  Brandon Sanderson is an awesome Fantasy writer so the conclusion of the series is in good hands 2  Robert Jordan can tend to be wordy at times and some of the books along the way feel a little bloated  but each one does advance the story 3  The narration is done by 2 excellent narrators Michael Kramer and Kate Reading  Each chapter will be read by one or the other depending on the chapter s main character  If the main character is female then Kate will read the entire chapter including the male voices  Michael will handle the chapters where the main character is male and he will do the female voices  This means that you must get accustomed to 2 voices for each character  This put me off at first but I quickly became accustomed to it and now I really enjoy the format 4  After a few books the narrators change the way they pronounce certain character names and this can throw you off until you realize that it is just a pronunciation change and not a different character  Just be prepared for it I am glad I started this long journey and I feel that audio is one of the best ways to experience Jordan s work  I had read The Eye of the World years ago but it didn t inspire me to keep going forward in the series  where the audiobook left me wanting more  I m now halfway through Kings dark Tower series  which I think is the best work he s done  I have to add add that my enjoyment of this remarkable story  with its wide array of characters  plot lines  environments  moods and literary  cultural references  has been incredibly enriched by the dramatic range and richness Frank Muller s voice and his phenomenal ability to become John Wayne  an AfricanAmerican prostitute  a gravelvoiced gunslinger  a frightened young boy  a vengeful maiden aunt  a cynical New York junkie or a young woman in love  His impressions of very different wellknown people are deadon  and he can even sing well when called for  He is not only believable in all the roles he plays  but his emotional intelligence adds to the heights and depths of the rollercoaster ride that King takes us on  I will seriously consider buying any book that he narrates he s that good   I read the Kindle version of this book when it first came out and loved it  I was so excited to see the autobiography of Captain Kathryn Janeway available as an audiobook added to my excitement was the fact that Kate Mulgrew was narrating the book and it was wonderful to listen to it with her voice  She did a perfect job of course  because nobody else could be the Captain of Voyager  This book just felt like it invested far too much time on the main protagonist sulking and feeling sorry for himself  He gets dumped on constantly and seems to accept this as his just reward  I can understand a bit of struggles when it s balanced with something good  but this rarely seems to be the case here  The narration was pretty good though  I am so glad I eventually clicked on this book  I had not read Rules of Civility  but was looking for something uplifting for easy summer reading and the description seemed to fit  What I received instead was a masterpiece which carried me to another place and time  only to remind me of the quiet goodness and dignity of everyday people in ordinary life  whom I encounter daily What first struck me  however  was the beautiful language  Lyrical and complex yet so easy to read  It feels more like a conversation with the author  than a novel  The main character is both prodigious and ordinary  He speaks with the authority of royalty  yet feels at times like your grandfather who wants to share his hard fought wisdom  We are with him through tumultuous changes as he realizes the folly of the comfort found in heirlooms and traditions that are passed from generation to generation  objects that lead us to believe that  the passing of an era would indeed be glacial   Instead  political upheaval in Russia forces Alexander Rostov to acknowledge old ideas can be swept away in an instantespecially when the  men in charge distrust any form of hesitation  or nuance  and who prize selfassurance above all   He finds himself among the  humbled   those who  greet adulation with caution  ambition with sympathy  and condescension with an inward smile   We follow the life of this man as he resolves that small actions can restore a sense of order The plot does just what it should  it twists and turns  surprises and satisfies but this is so much more than good story telling  It s the rare book that causes you to slow down as you approach the last chapters  to feel like a friend has moved away when you turn the last page  and make the next book you start just a little harder to get into Lastly  the narration is perfectly matched to the story  I ve listened to audio books since 1998  this is probably my favorite narrator  If you re old enough to knowhe s something like Mr  French meets Shelby Foote  without the southern accent   If that s a meaningless reference to you  just know this narration is sublime and somehow articulates the inward smile and humble brilliance that is Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov  When we last left Feyre  she freed Tamlin  his court and the whole of Prythian  But at the cost of killing two innocent fae  So the last book ended with Feyre having to deal with the aftermath of her actions and of dying and being resurrected as a High Fae If you come into this book curious about how Feyre is coping  Or wanting to know what was up with Rhysand stumbling during his last interaction with Feyre  Or what is up with the bargain he made with Feyre  Or what exactly began Tamlin and Rhys  enmity  Or what are the other courts like  Or what the hell Feyre s last name is Then your curiousity will be satisfied However  if you come into this book with a high investment on who Feyre ends up with  all I can say is that you will either be very elated or crushingly disappointed Personally  I like the book and its continuity with the first book  I like how the author handles Feyre s character development for this book  I don t really care much about who Feyre ends up with as I like both the guys introduced in the first book But from a shipping perspective  I can pretty much see how a reader rooting for one guy would be enraged or elated at how the romance department goes So just be preparedFinally  I just want to comment that this title should not be under the Teen category  If you re a parent who has any plans on buying this for under 17 children  you might have reservations because this book has even more graphic sex scenes than the first book  This book is full of typical  anecdotal statements about  genius  habits that are only ever written about because they re what shallowminded people  or at least people who don t care much for rigorous evidence  must love reading  Even though the author says on numerous occasions how  studies have shown  this or that point he s trying to make  his use of the statement is embarrassingly misleading and lacking any sort of intelligent backing There are a handful of good points made by the author  but mainly in his analysis of what other authors have missed in their analyses of the subject  I don t think he has contributed any original or useful ideas of his own We will have to continue waiting and hoping someone who knows how to present rigorous evidence to the masses writes a book in this genre  The Narrator has an excellent voice but I think he lays it on a bit thick  There are times where the narrator is speaking in the narrator voices and he purposefully puts on this flowery english accent that makes it hard to follow  I do like to listen to books while I work but I just can t passively listen and follow the story due to narration  The opening was good with the conversation between the Thiefmaker and the Priest however I am now completely lost there are characters never introduced I think there was a time jump  It is also hard to follow since all the characters voices sound the same  Will have to relisten when I can really focus on the book  Thoroughly enjoyed this audiobook  Loved the content  flow and length  Too many biographies are far too long  This book beautifully highlighted the career of Iger without a lot of the meaningless detail  Wish more biographies were written in this fashion  If you are a Christian nerd like I am then you will struggle between the absolute joy that can come from Bob s snarky nature  and the amazing depth of world building  nerd talk verses the disappointment in how the story literally makes Christians into a villainous  manipulative  and obstinate group who want to bring back the dark ages    That is unless they are only faking their belief in order to not be tortured and brainwashed into a puppet  Sure the book doesn t center around it s very clear antichristian sentiment  but it does dwell on it quite a bit as a plot device The main problem with this is how apparently the people in charge of the Christian s in this story clearly have no understanding of Christian moral principles  and how the rest of Christian s are apparently mindless sheep willing to follow who ever is in charge    I m sorry but while it is true that the Church regardless of denomination as an organization and as a people have flaws  as well as people who should not even be considered Christians find positions of leadership for their own devices    It is overall a gathering of imperfect people who believe in something greater than themselves  and who try to live up to a standard of morals that is in all honesty really hard to maintain  Are Christian s perfect no  are there hippocrates and immoral people who are great at acting sure  But overall that is not what defines the majority of believers  Loved it and didn t stop until it was finished  I love this series and it s my favorite genre  This book focuses on promoting the psychosocial development of your child ren   Which  in my opinion  is of vital importance in today s culture  If you get this book thinking it will help you earn your kid a few more IQ points or improve her math grades  you ll have to take a step back and look at the big picture  Confident  secure  and articulate people are more likely to perform to their full potential in every aspect of their lives  than people who hold themselves back  This book provided useful tools that I have been able to apply successfully with my 3 year old son  as well as tools I am keeping in mind for when he is older  I highly recommend this book for anyone with children up through preadolescence  I think they have a separate book for the teen years There is a male and female narrator who switch back and forth reading sections  The female narrator doesn t have a good voice for it  although she gives a flawless performance  But the pacing is fine  The sections that are meant for young kids are a little annoying to hear  and the appendix is a snooze  But otherwise the performance does not detract from the book  Chris Voss mentions this book in his never split the difference and when an author quotes another book I usually check it out  Im very happy I did so in this case My wait of about 4 years for the audible version was worth it  Actually no  I was dumb enough to wait  I shouldve done the heavy lifting and read this book right after Vosss book The structure is solid  the narration great and the help in applying the lessons learned exemplary  If you care about becoming a better negotiator  dont say no to this book  I really enjoyed this book and the other four books in the Thomas Prescott series  There is a very good suspense as well as some very laughable sarcastic remarks  The series is narrated by Johnny Heller  When ever I hear his voice I automatically think of Prescott  Hellers delivery of sarcasm is spot on Anyway  this book has a very entertaining story  It held my interest and kept me wanting more  You think you know whats going of and the motivations of the antagonists but it changes and then again I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank You  Good  solid communication book  Novel framework  timeless advice  relevant  entertaining anecdotes In response to some other reviews  I didn t think the intro was whiny or that there was excessive namedropping I took off a star because there really should be an accompanying PDF accessable from the ToC  That might seem petty  but this book has several charts that the narrator had to describe instead of reference  Not a big deal for ones that don t have many elements  but not all fall into that category The narrator reminds me of Kitty from Dharma  Greg  I was completely sold on the overwhelming amount of positive reviews for this book  I was SO excited  The premise is unique  the location and characters are unique  and other people seemed to really love this book  Initially I thought it was the narration  I just could not get into the story  But I really tried to stay with it because some of the BEST books start off slow and turn into something magically if you just persevere  As the chapters rolled by I watched my hope evaporate by the minute  No character development  no atmosphere  no depth whatsoever  completely 2D characters  It was such a letdown  The dialogue is super basic  it was just so vanilla  Pedestrian  The writing doesnt ever CONNECT you to the places or people  There is no feeling  Its vapid and boring  Sorry  I know everyone else seems to think this book was just phenomenal  I want my money back  Total letdown  I wish I could respond to the reviews from people who mentioned that they wished they had bought the kindle hard copy and let them know that the worksheets are available to download  and print  free online in a PDF  This was a relief for me as I began to listen to the audiobook  and realized the reviews were right  You really do need the worksheets to get the full benefit from this book  I just googled the title   worksheets  and the first result was a free PDF download  Spread the info  This book manages to do something that is rarely accomplished with such a serious subject  It s well thought out and methodical but simultaneous emotional and sincerely heartfelt  Written as a letter to his son Coates explains how to exist in modern day America as a black man  He gets very introspective and deeply personal when sharing annidotes about his life and each story lead to a deeper understanding for him  If I were to write a handbook on how to raise a black male who s conscious of his circumstances but not resigned to other people s ideas of who he is  and taking those lessons to transcend what America thinks he s capable of  this would be that handbook After listening to this book  I ordered 10 hardback copies and gave one to each of my nephews and my uncles  I find myself quoting TaNehisi now like some pretentious fanboy posting Bieber lyrics on twitter  But that s how much this literary masterpiece touched me and continues to resonate after reading it 3 times  with more to come  Suffice to say  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys discovering new literary geniuses in the making  He s an enjoyable narrator with a soothing baritone voice  I love when authors narrate their own books  The pacing and his vocal inflection was pitch perfect throughout  5 stars all around  The authors take us on an easytounderstand grand tour of the science of computer algorithms  stopping  sorting  caching  predicting  game theory  and much more  and then do a marvelous job of explaining The application of these algorithms to the most mundane problems of everyday human experience  parking  dating  remembering  playing poker  etc  A tour de force  I enjoyed it greatly  and recommended it to several friends  I wanted very badly to love this  or even like it a littlenothing close happened  Just about when you d think the characters are developed enough to actually do something the end  but not like a big  the end  more of just  I m tired of writing let s wrap this sh t up and be done  the narration was at least good  but could ve done without Atwood announcing different parts chapters  imo she s not hit the voice for that  spoiler  the last 20 minutes was more of a waste of time than the first 13    mind numbing hours  Despite its critical acclaim  instant bestseller status  innumerable awards  and snappedup movie rights  I hesitated to read  Red  White  and Royal Blue   The title seemed too  cute  The book cover seemed too  cute  The theme seemed too  cute  Wow  am I sorry I waited   Red  White  and Royal Blue  meets and exceeds the attention it has earned  It has everything warmly drawn and winning characters  a wonderful story  fascinating settings  romance  cutthroat politics  hilarious humor  palace intrigue  current events  love of family  thrills  pop culture  history  sex  very  very hot sex   excitement  love  courage  betrayal  hope for the future  fireworks  and a cliffhanger or two  Reading this book  you will be utterly charmed  You will also fall in love  you will often laugh out loud  and sometimes  you will cry  Oh  will you cry I  read  this by following the Kindle ebook text while listening to the brilliant voice acting of awardwinning actor Ramon De Ocampo  He was a revelation  He nimbly navigated different characters  different accents  even different languages in a way that gave great life to the story and depth to his characters  and he did it all with a seeming ease and total naturalness  I ve rarely heard a more assured and enjoyable performance  If you re thinking about buying the Kindle version  buy the Audible version to go with it  You won t regret it Lastly   Red  White  and Royal Blue  benefits from a second reading  The author s subtle foreshadowing  her placement of little clues of what s to come  is even more enjoyable the second time around and gives a second reading depth and nuance  You ll enjoy it even more the second time Especially in these times  we need things that bring us a little escape  a little brightness  and sheer joy   Red  White  and Royal Blue  does exactly that  Highly  highly recommended  Serena huffs and puffs throughout  Its barely listenable  Huge disservice  The parts Sage reads saves it  The central short story   A River Runs Through it  deals with the themes of love  family  obligation  and the huge challenge of what it is that we can and can t do on behalf of those that we love  Of course  fly fishing is also mentioned a time or two   I loved this and I glad I found it  The themes are timeless and really resonated with me  I can t imagine anybody not thoroughly enjoying these stories  Radical Acceptance is a rather thorough walk through Buddhist practices that are applicable to daily life  highlighted by numerous personal antecodes from the author  either from her own experiences  or from those she has mentored   I found RA to be an extremely pleasant and valuable listen with believable  downtoearth examples  Cassandra Campbell is a great choice for narratorI enjoyed her evenkeel delivery  Some segments of the book felt a touch lengthy  perhaps the book could have been 1020 shorter at most  I would not be surprised if I turn back to this book every year or so for relistening If you struggle with stress  selfimage  and or overpowering emotions  RA is an fantastic choice  I think what attracts me to Buddhist teachings is that the hook is selfcenteredget more out of life  take care of yourselfbut the way is ultimately through the people and world around you  Below is a loose collection of notes I captured while working through the book  Listen and enjoy  Be your own best friend Radical Acceptancethe acceptance of life as it isis how one breaks the  Trance of Unworthiness  that we put ourselves under First step to freedom recognize your own suffering Feeling inadequate is not your fault  nor is that feeling unique to you Acceptance is clearly seeing reality  compassion for others The  mara  are the temptations of life  Welcome their enterance  and their subsequent passing  and understand they are not your fault  To do so is to be your own best friend   Carencia  is when the bull in a bullfight pauses  Its the sign of strongest bulls  Practice smile yoga  Don t compare your life s cooking to Pillsbury biscuits  Pain is a very important messenger  Pain is inevitable  but suffering is optional  Emotional traumas cause dissociation  Dissociation leads to recurrences of neuroses until event is revisited and understood  To define yourself by desire is to miss out on life  Don t fully suppress desireit is responsible for a lot of good in this world  Buddha the teacher  Dharma the way  Sangra the community  Turn to your community  Coping with fear and remorse is all  necessary  practice for death  Compassion for others is spiritual selfdiscovery  I sought my soul  but my soul I could not see  I sought my God  but my God eluded me  I sought my brother  And I found all three    William Blake The Spy and the Traitor was one of the best books Ive ever read  I was hoping this would be similar  It was good  but it was so extensive and covered so many years that inevitably there were an incredible amount of contacts code names double and triple agents  It was hard to follow at some points  I still enjoyed it but there was more rewinding to relisten than I usually do  The story of Thomas Covenant is difficult because he truly is a Antihero  lord Fouls Bane does at times bury you with descriptions and vocabulary but the characters are believable and vivid  The struggles become palpable the emotions intense  I have read the whole series at least 8 times just to re experience and find new things I missed before  As I have aged different parts become more relevant but as a whole the story holds true over time  like Covenant I encourage you to slip into the land soak up its richness and be changed and formed into a new being  I listened to Without Remorse first which introduced me to John Clark in his early career  I bought Rainbow Six with a lot of hesitation because of the negative review about he narrator I have completely enjoyed the book and the narrator  I highly recommend the book and the narrator I have bought over 200 books from Audible and this book was really enjoyable  Buy it if you want a nice long listen that is loads of fun  Leslie Jordan could read a phone book and I would find it entertaining  For those of you who dont remember phone books  well    This is the story of Circe  the daughter of the Sungod  who gets exiled to an island  and comes into her own as a witch and as a woman  I don t know  everyone says this book is so feminist  and I guess I just don t see it  I thought Circe s character was dull to be honest  And the only parts of the book that were actually interesting to me  were the parts where she interacted with others  But as she is exiled pretty early on in the book  to an island which she can t leave  those parts weren t prevalent in the story  I liked almost all the other charcters better  and that was hard going for me  since this story was told from Circe s perspective  Another problem I had was the span of this tale  which literally spun thousands of years  and almost all the action was brought to you in a very peripheral way  It picked up by the ending  though which was excellent  If only Circe had stood  spoken up for herself sooner  I would have liked this tale a whole lot more All of that asisde  I think the writing is beautiful and it reads like a fairy tale that keeps you interested all the way  You don t have to know anything about Greek Mythology to enjoy this  My own knowlegde was limited at best  I didn t even know who Circe was  at the start  and everything is explained very well  and in a manner that s very organic I would recommend this to anyone who likes stories with a large scope with beautiful proze and a female character coming of age  and finding out where her value lies  I think that the whole discussion on immortality was very interesting and welldone  tooI thought the narration was excellent  Her voices really takes you everywhere  and almost had a lulling quality  quite magical  I thought it was really wellsuited to Circe This book has all of the key components to a good YA novel  There s outcast girl  boy who find they re soul mates an overly protective AfricanAmerican caregiver humorous secretive uncle and a paranormal twist  I didn t love this story and found some of the characters to be irritating stereotypes  the mean girls at school   Overall  it was a decent attempt  but could have been better  While I enjoyed the story  I won t listen to the next in the series  This debut novel is impossible to put down and swept me away on a tantalizing journey through 1950s Jaipur  I found the entire cast of characters fully realized in the author s lyrical words  and the story replete with color and culture  I especially enjoyed the clever interplay of the audience s realizations with the protagonist s  along with her internal discourse as she is faced with the hefty weight of fate and external machinations balancing on a knife s edge  Phenomenal book  As a man who mostly listens to fantasy and science fiction novels  this was a very unusual choice for me  Although apparently more than 1 2 of the USA would know who this woman was  I did not  for I had never heard of the  Girls Next Door  reality show Ms  Madison does a very brief introduction of herself but quickly gets to where she moves into the Playboy mansion  Over 90 of the book is her describing a listless and unpleasant life where she can drive fancy cars and buy 1000 of clothes per month  but is prevented from advancing in life by draconian rules The main purpose of the book seemed to attempting to demonstrate to everybody how terrible Hugh Hefner is  and that she herself was just an innocent and intelligent girl that got herself in a bad situation  This is not her life story  There is so much left out of the narrative that it sometimes feels like she just wanted to cherry pick events where she felt she was wronged  For example  there is one instance where a security guard that had been friendly was rude to her  It had no reason to be included except that it bothered her On the other had  she really had no description of her life before the mansion  We don t know what her family had to say about any of this  What about high school and college boyfriends  There is only the briefest description of sexual activities that she participated in  because she wouldn t want to talk about that Overall  I thought this a much better book than you d expect  Ms  Madison did a good job explaining exactly how everyday life worked in this bizarre household  My impression was that Ms  Madision indeed is no dummy  and that she did make some really terrible choices  but in the end  I think she did manage to skillfully turn it around in the end  Despite the shortcomings of this book  I mostly enjoyed it because it was so far out of my world  I don t know any people like this  who s life revolved around clothes  make up  and mind games with catty women So while keeping in mind that she wrote this self serving book because  as she states many times  she doesn t want people to think of her as a dumb bimbo  I still think she is a likable person  and I found it worth listening to  Before I picked this one up  I actually thought it was going to be super technical  Id only ever listened to one podcast featuring Bhatia  and that was a while ago  so I couldnt remember what his style was  Especially given the subject  I assumed I was in for a bit of a slog However  this book is anything but that  and I think thats why I found it to be quite good  Bhatia takes something thats super complex and vague  the layered money system  and breaks it down in just a handful of hours  More importantly  he does so in a way that just about anyone can understand Though I liked the entire book  the last third was my favorite  In that part  Bhatia takes all the layered money concepts he covers in the first twothirds and applies them to Bitcoin and digital currencies Overall  its a very good read and one that I recommend Brian SachettaAuthor of Get Out of Your Head Maybe the best Audible book I have ever listened to  Its always great having the author of an autobiography read their own work and this narration is pure perfection  I laughed from beginning to end and learned a ton while doing so  Download this ASAP and enjoy This was one of the best books on Audible  yet one of the most painful  Richard Pryor was an exceptional talent and his insights in this book are amazing  I would have liked to hear more about some of his professional relationships and it seemed that he only skims the surface when talking Eddie Murphy  Redd Foxx  and Gene Wilder  One of the best and most brutally honest autobiographies Ive read  Sinclair is the single most interesting scientist I know of  and I just can t get enough of hearing about his and his field s discoveries and the promising future of human biology Sinclair s discoveries have had a direct impact in me completely regaining my own health after years of Lyme Disease and fatigue  and he is in large part the reason for my newly started journey towards medical school I can safely say this is currently my all time favorite book 5 5 no question  Well written and well narrated by the author himself  I blew through it in two days Thank you  David  The objection I have to this book is that the author is not a fasting or obesity researcher  and she seems to be heavily pushing some ideas that are about her own approach to things  She says again and again that she s researched things  but is leaving out the most current research  For example  she prefers one huge meal at night and likes snacking and a  delay don t deny  approach that could lead to binging and also spreads the impression that you can have snacks and sugar and unhealthy foods and everything will be fine  when modern research is proving that is not the case  and it is the type of food you eat that makes you fat  not just when you eat or how much There s lots of research now showing that eating sugary foods ups insulin levels and leads to insulin resistance  so if you re eating one big bomb of a meal per day and still eating sugary foods  your metabolism will be out of whack and you may well need to  deny  certain foods most of the time if you want to be healthy and avoid insulin resistance and diabetes So she s sprinkling a little reserach in  but ignoring research that doesn t support her idea of  delay  don t deny   You do have to deny  most of the time  things that are well proven to cause negative metabolic changes and are empty junk not supporting the body s nutritional needs  If you re eating them  you re not eating things that are good for you and that will help you lose weight and maintain that loss She on the one hand says one must  clean fast  on only water during a fast and not even allowing a spot of cream in coffee  yet research has shown that that won t affect anything  Then she turns around and says that you can have that ice cream and cookies  later  when the reality is those will deeply impact your insulin levels and health as empty calories  while a dollop of cream in your coffee on a fast won t affect anything  Intermittent fasting can be useful  but the way you eat and what you eat is critcially important to maintaining your health If you want to read a book that is based on modern research  by legitimate researchers   then get  The Obesity Code  by Dr  Fung  He s also written books about fasting that are better and based on science rather than the idea that you can gorge yourself once a day and eat sugar and empty snacks and everything will be fine  It won t  As an excop S W A T Team member I expected more bravado  false or otherwise  but this was real  The stuff those that serve our nation and our communities really feel when they are not trying to appear like they are taking it all in stride  I was riveted and deeply moved  This is how it really feels to serve  Thank you for writing this book  I will read it again soon  and probably again after that  Rarely do I feel this way but this author is someone whom I would like to meet one day and thank her for so many things  And yes  Im sitting with good posture as I write this  Thank you Maam  And thank you for your service  I am a liberal  I purchased this book because of Joe Rogan s interview with Crenshaw where he advocates  Do something hard   That intrigued me so I listened to the book  I was relieved to hear him Express ideas similar to what I believe  He even managed to change my mind on an issue or two  This guy who is obviously Christian straight and white  did make some points with which I disagree  However he made those points intelligently and explained why he felt that particular way  Crenshaw is witty  honest  and relatable  He reminds me of what I love about America our resilience and positivity through turbulence  I wrote history never taught  Im sure I learned some of this in school but I honestly dont remember much  I know the overall theme of how black history was taught  I know I was led to believe that all was well and this thing in our past was no more than a footnote in our illustrious and victorious history Ive listened to a few books so far this year on this topic  Truth be told  I didnt feel like downloading this  but its February and I felt like it was important to continue to learn and feed my mind on this issue  This is my promise as a white man to continue to be an ally and not feed into any more white washing  I feel Ive always been an ally but its continually more difficult to stand up for what I believe  Truth be told Im scared to confront people on their racism but what this book does is give me the tools I need to have a conversation  I need to educate others instead of arguing and fighting  Thanks for the book and all the work that went into it  I completely related to this and I learned a lot about myself through it  I will be able to use what Ive learned in real life situations  As a 46 year old male  exMarine  and self professed nice guy I finally understand that all this time  I have been causing my own pain  It hasnt been my career  my spouse  my friends  my environmental conditions  The common factor in all those things has been me  No more Mr  nice guy described many of my own internal feelings like someone was reading my mind  Things that Ive never told anyone  Now that I have clarity on these issues  I now have a way to work through them to be set free  Ive already applied some of the techniques with immediate results  Mainly because the change started with me  which then encouraged positive responses from others  So basically  now Im in the process of reviewing all of my thoughts and actions to challenge and change the defaults  If you even think this book might help you  take a chance  I did and Im so very thankful to the author  The scope of this series is incredible and makes you feel smaller in the universe with each book you read  Mindblowing sci fi concepts that are well researched  some reviewers say charecter development is  flat  but the author makes up for it with great imagery and imagination  Great almost seemless translation into english and i like this narrorator better than the one for the 2nd and 3rd book I cant begin to tell you how this book has changed my life  My thinking about alcohol has completely changed so much so that I no longer have a desire to chase the dragon  Once you truly understand what alcohol is and how  although worse than many other drugs  is marketed to our society you will begins to DESPISE it  Then when you find out what alcohol is made of and how it affects your brain you will wonder how you could ever have a drink again  BUT when you are made aware of the fact that you are not funnier or cuter when drinking and that the glass of wine you reach for to relax and be happy actually does the exact opposite you will NEVER want another drink again  This book proved undoubtedly that you do NOT need alcohol to have a good time or to be social Annie is so precise in detailing all of these facts and more in a guilt free  no judgement zone  She also delves into how our brain works and precisely delivers steps to form new paths in our brain that painlessly help to kick the alcohol habit once and for all and for good I also love the on line groups  support system the Facebook page and especially the 30 day Challenge  Thanks Annie for helping me to be FREE OF ALCOHOL    AF The original text by Dr  Covey is preserved  however  after each section  Sean  one of his sons  shares real world and up close and personal examples that bring the reader deeper and more intimately into the content and it s real life application  I was many chapters in waiting to learn something new that I wasn t already doing to some degree  Finally  he mentions that this book is for those who are younger  That s how you get rich   start young  I m going to listen to the end but it s hard because I m hearing about tactics and strategies I am familiar with for an extended amount of time  A well executed masterpiece of humor and sincerity that dives into the complexities of mental health and how it affects us all  Articulating not only the trials that we endure but provides solutions and support to the hurdles our brains go through  A beautiful guide on how we all will get through this night  I listen to audiobooks about history constantly but this is the only one Ive listened to straight through over the course of a day  Writing consists of vivid storytelling interwoven so deftly with scientific and historical information that you accidentally learn a ton while being entertained  The narrator is the best Ive heard and his renditions of sad poems  various accents  and individual characters earn him my Best Ever Award  The narrator was enjoyable to listen to  She did a great job with the various accents and pronunciations and had different voices for each character Pros the story idea is great  I had never heard of the Alice network and enjoyed that  The author did a good job of switching between the stories and tying them together so they dovetailed nicely at the end  Despite the cons I will list next  it was engaging and I wanted to know how it would end Cons agree with many others who have said they enjoyed Eve s story but found Charlie insufferable  The equations   little problem    rosebud  as references or literary devices were annoying and distracting  However the one that really drove me crazy was the constant use of the word   lagonda   The author used it at every point when one could have said   car  and also added it unnecessarily when a vehicle is already implied  I rolled my eyes and cringed a lot during the Charlie chapters and sped up to 1 25 I don t regret listening to it but won t listen again  This would have been better reading because then I could have skimmed through a lot  Also  as others have noted  there were a lot of gratuitous sex scenes and foul language  presumably for shock value and to establish these as  modern   relatable women  though I couldn t relate to them  I almost didn t download this one from the reviews that were posted  But all of Riordan s other books have been great  I just had to find out for myself  And I am glad I did  Tremendous story great characters and the narrator s alright  If you pass on this one because of the narration you re missing out  If you pass because of what others have written  well then you probably don t need to read about heroes  Sleep as much as you can and take naps when youre tired   Drink water as soon as you get up in the morning   Eat a well balanced diet of fresh unprocessed foods   Workout using a blend of movements and exercises   Smoke weed   Have sex   I just saved you 10 hours  Its great Aubreys Onnit thing has taken off and changed  Ive listened to him on a few podcast and hes charismatic with some decent thoughts and theories which is why I can see hes successful in business  However nothing in the book is groundbreaking  Everything he mentions has been around in the fitness circles for years  Sleep long  eat well  drink plenty water  has sex and exercise  Maybe the paperback version would have some good reference material for someone who has never read a Health and wellness book before but the audible version sounds like a plug for his company and it even feels like at times hes bragging about his awesome Own it life  If I were getting a complete motivation book about owning the day and being the best you I would pass on this one  Of course I love the books and all things HP  Otherwise  why would I buy the audiobook   Jim Dale is one of the best narrators that I ve ever heard  He truly brings all the HP books to life with his voices for each character I am embarrassed to say that I have listened to the HP books more than once because it s such a joy hearing them read by Mr  Dale  I flew through this book  The narrator is different from the first book  but after the initial surprise I got over that and grew to like the narrator  He does a good job with the lady of shadows  Hello   The reviewer who gave Richard Ferrone a thumbs down on this book is obviously behind the eight ball  Ferrone is THE voice of Lucas and all the recent Sanford Prey audible books  Love LOVE his subtle intonations and way of imparting dry humor  I cant imagine another narrator doing the series  Keep up the fine work Richard As for the book itself  one of the best John Sanford novels  Its edgy  It kept me guessing what was coming next  Many authors get formulaic after so many books in a series  They start cutting the books way down  They turn and churn them into serial stories  Are you listening Stuart Woods   Sanford has managed to keep things sharp and fresh  Good for you John  keep it up  And keep Ferrone on the team  This was a pretty interesting book  I don t agree with all of the reasoning  but it s an interesting theory The one downside to this book is that if you re looking for motivation  it might work the opposite effect This book is about how luck and certain circumstances make you more likely to be successful such as your birthdate  ethnicity  and religion If you easily see your circumstances as beyond your control  you may read this book and feel disheartened that you re not lucky or have the right circumstances to be successful I believe luck is part of it  but drive and ambition are also important too  You DO have the power to alter your circumstances  even if you ve not been given special advantages  Narration  Threw me off at first  as nearly all the accents are thick and some were hard to tell apart  but by then end the characters feel familiar Plot  At first it seemed like another  bad guy gets powerful magical artifact that lets him do anything   but gladly it took a bit of a different turn as more of the plot unfolds  It felt less gripping than some of Hamilton s other titles  but less action suspense now set us up for more character and plot development down the line Characters  Unlike most fantasy series  by the end of book 1 the main character still feels like an average guy in extraordinary circumstances  with one exceptional ability but nothing overpowered  I hope this continues even as the character grows into his own more  Backstory is minimal for everyone other than the MC  but there is significant development of the overall Middle Sea world s history  for everyone who s read Hamilton s other titles  Overall  Definitely worth it for readers new to the Middle Sea or those already familiar with Hamilton s world  but don t expect to be swept up quite as quickly as some of his other titles  When I saw that both Julia Whelan and Lauren Fortgang were narrating this book  I thought to myself this Hass to be good   and was it ever This book was so good  I was finding excuses to take longer walks and even scrub my floors just so I could get another couple of chapters in to hear what was happening next  It was so very well written and thought out with so many twists and turns  And I just love the way that it ended  If youre on the fence about purchasing this book  dont wait any longerYou will not be disappointed  This book is the perfect follow up to Jenny Lawsons previous books Let s Pretend This Never Happened and Furiously Happy  Its read by Jenny Lawson herself and has a number of wonderful stories  chapters  and for those who are familiar with her writing  easter eggs  It also has an accompanying PDF with wonderful photos  This is an amazing book to listen to when you need to relax  need a break  or just need to feel different  If you enjoy this style of writing I strongly recommend you to try this book   One of my favorites  5 star reads are a rare  so despite not really being drawn in by the editors description  I thought Id give it a try  I was not disappointed  It has thoroughly developed characters  mystery and suspense  and at the same time is a social commentary on race  poverty and injustice In short  it is about a group of people living in a NYC housing project as drug lords are rising in power  So the background is a rather dismal gritty housing project  But the focus of the book is on a group of flawed  but ultimately loving and caring characters from all walks of life  It is both a social commentary on the injustices of society and the ability of human beings to love and care for one another despite it all  I would also recommend it for quarantine reading as despite the setting  it is an uplifting book  I am a voracious audible reader and have never read anything like this  Honestly  I dont know how the author did what he did  but deacon King Kong is a masterpiece My only suggestion is that the reader was a bit slow for my personal taste  but I bumped the speed to 1 1 or 1 2 and it was perfect  The voices were great  whiners stop you from grabbing this listen I ve had this book in my wish list since it was released     like a fool   I was put off the listen    by the reviews complaining about the use of the word  redacted  I thoroughly enjoyed  The Terminal List  and now feel like a fool for not just grabbing this when it hit Audible  Maharushdie  The Doctor of Democracy mentioned it a few days ago  said he d read it was a great read and paralleled the news of the day     and well   I thought    WTH   d mn the redacted   I m going in   and so glad I did It s almost two stories blending into one  the first part is a bit gut wrenching  given the nature of the task Reece s take on  I apricated the fact Mr Carr approached the need for better ways to control poachers without preaching at me  I don t need a social justice warrior disguised as a fiction writing author Mr Carr doesn t even get close to that  he tells a compelling story about the bush and poachers When the story shifts to Reece stepping back into his rouge ex Seal shoes again  the action is non stop  the story at times feels ripped right out of todays headlines As far as the word  redacted  being used     it doesn t ruin the story or the flow of the story at all  Some folks are just wound to tight  LOL I M O  it added a bit more intrigue to the theme  There s a few times it used   that almost strikes me that the word is being used for a satirical effect over actual need to avoid disclosures of some information Mr  Carr knows his stuff    he s not blowing smoke and the knowledge he has of firearms displayed in the story is wide in scope phenomenal Ray Porter has a spot on sense of the characters  the dialects  nuances  inflections  he nails it all  His ability to use a feminine lilt without sounding forced is a bonus  easy on the ears I feel an addiction coming on  Bring on Book 3    This prologue begins with a hunt for a woman  Not looking for a woman but an actual hunt with a cross bow  The antagonist references The Most Dangerous Game by Richard Connell  You dont know in those first paragraphs but the man is hunting Raife Hastings sister Raife is a very prominent character from the first two books  Meanwhile James Reece is recovering with Katie by his side from surgery to remove the brain tumor diagnosed in book one  Hes invited to Montana by his friend Raife Hastings to recuperate  Instead of getting some much needed RR he and Raife are ambushed by members of a Russian mob  Of course they are defeated when the CIA is warned by a hostile mole about the coming ambush  The men have been hired by an exCIA Officer with a grudge against the two friends  Its up to Reece to end it or both families will be looking over their shoulders for the rest of their lives  But human malignancies reside right here also I dont want to give away any spoilers but remember the human hunt in the prologue   Ray Porter is an incredible narrator and he reads this book as if it were his words This book has my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank You  I found Madame Speaker a super entertaining way to learn about the complexity of US Congress and the complex woman leading the Democrats for two decades  It is both fun to listen to and a complete education all on its own  The author narrates the book in a clear and engaging manner  interspersing insiders  anecdotes throughout the serious accounts of Pelosi s unique life experiences and leadership style  Makes a great gift for audiobook friends  As a daughter of Appalachia who has been misplaced in the mountains of Colorado instead of back home in the Western NC mountains  I love the author s ability to recognize both the strengths and weaknesses of being from the hills  A million times better representation of these dear people than that other book which discussed the hillbilly tale of woe  Thank you for shining a light  i have made this recommended reading for my book club  Love this book cant have it too far from me  I would recommend you start from beginning to end don t skim through it  When will Jessies team learn that it is best for the safety of everyone to let her know things before hand  Never  And it makes for some seriously explosive and funny scenes  The stars are aligning  Her team is getting stronger  Her powers are blooming  or should I say booming   To add to the mix  she and Austin are quickly sliding in to mating and Elliot Graves has a few tricks to throw at them as well  Will vengeance be had or will the hole dang mountain tumble down on everyone  Another fantastically epic story full of laughs  excitement  a bit of violence and some steamy scenes  Love  love  love it    The story was fine overall but was internally Inconsistent Previously one of the biggest problems the developers had was an inability to change or do anything with Rorick and the code he had interacted with This was either forgotten or ignored in order to take away a powerful artifact from him in this book  which was previously stated  repeatedly  to be immune to their tampering and incapable of being interacted with Minus the ignoring of previously important information for the pushing through of plot  it was still a fun story  This novel was a compelling read and I learned a lot about Koreans in Japan  I had read in other places about the difficulties of becoming a Japanese citizen if you were an expatriate  even if you were born in Japan  The novel is sprawling in the time that it covers and the characters  I wished it was less broadly based and more narrowly focus since I don t think I found out much about the interior lives and personalities of the characters  I ended up thinking they were all a little blank save for their hard work and perseverance  While that may make an interesting read  it did not captivate me in the ways I would have wanted it  Plot lines were elaborated only to be dropped  the death of some of the main characters are mentioned but that is all  I kept asking myself what the author wanted to impart and I can t say for sure I know  The narration was really good though  both in Korean and Japanese  Words can not describe the incredible gift Dr  Eger has given the world with this book  I am so moved by the book  her story  what she has done for so many people  our military servicemen and women and many others  This book and her story will live forever and I know that I will reread it and cherish it for all my life  And offer it to family and friends wherever I go  I have The Choice in both Audible and hardcover  It is great on Audible  God Bless Edith and her family and her gift  I was raised to be a monogamous minister s daughter and really appreciate the open minded and broad horizons they laid out in this book  Normalizing the freedom to love and have healthy relationships outside of the past limits was a much needed thing for me  The speaker was calm and gentle  It made it a very easy listen for me  I have already referred many people to this book  The story is a great story of course but the speaker s voice makes most of the characters sound like they re from the deep South    TwoBit  for instance  sounds like a drunken eeyore  Such slow speech and slow reaction they sound mentally disabled    a shame because most of the characters had never left the city and would not sound like that    The voice range isn t great either most characters sound like every other character   except darry and the socs  He did well with then  must be a soc in real life  What made the experience of listening to Year of Yes the most enjoyable  Steve Jobs life was interesting from day one  The book is well written and well read  I did not want the book to end  I did not want Steve Jobs  life to end  He was a unique individual with a passion for perfection  The book was well worth twenty five hours of my life  I have a little over an hour commute each way 5 days a week  I ve been listening to audio books during my commute just over two years  Its made a big difference in my life  Now I feel guilty on the days I just listen to the radio Narrators play an important role I was so happy to learn that the author narrated this book  However  hes a little bit flat  The first hour or so of the book was pretty dry and I didnt know if I would even continue listening  Im so glad I did  Its been a long time since a book really made stop and think  I had to keep pausing the audio to take a few minutes to think about things When I would share pieces of the book with friends or coworkers and tell them how troubling alarming I felt certain instances were their responses were pretty similar  They all said something along the lines of there had to be more to it and someone couldnt possibly be sent to death row or prison at those ages for those crimes  I would nod and say you have to read it Around this same time at a work lunch the topic of the death penalty came up  One of my coworkers strongly voiced her support of the death penalty and said things like what are we waiting for  Why does it take so long  Just kill them and save us some money  My stomach knotted  This is my coworker  who I genuinely like and trust and value the opinion of  I just responded  but  sometimes we get it wrong This book made me question our justice system on every level  my country  my peers and myself  Thats a first  Even with all that required reading in my past There were many moments that really hit me in my core  But  one stand out moment  was when the author  as a young black law student was stopped by police in his own neighborhood for doing absolutely nothing  and was compelled to run  That is where the book grabbed me and sucked me in  Of course it would be his instinct to run and how terrifying what the outcome could have been if hed followed his instinct  When he mentioned that his neighbors started coming out I initially felt relief and thought well thank goodness  they will give those cops the what for and set them straight  But no  They didnt do that Spending a good chunk of my early childhood in a pretty poor neighborhood I knew that cops and justice arent always exactly good or fair  And I saw a few alarming things even in a middle class predominantly white neighborhood in my teenage years  And  of course weve all been watching the news the last few years  So I didnt go into this book with rose colored glasses  But  I had no idea what I was in for Bryan Stevenson is one of the good guys  One of those people that you call angels on earth  We should all thank God for him and his work and his commitment to the forgotten  neglected or misjudged  I usually love Daniel Pink s work  but this was tired and repetitive  I find he is insightful and typically puts an original twist on common wisdom  He missed the mark on this one  He used the same formula of his past successes but this one felt like a 50100 page concept stretched out into a 200 pager to keep publishers happy  I would put the concepts in A Whole New Mind on par with the best works of Malcom Gladwell  Steven Levitt and Nassim Nicholas Taleb  This is recycled  repetitive and doesn t come close to his best  This is unquestionably the most amazing tale of men against the elements that I have ever read or heard  and it is told remarkably well by Lansing who draws artfully from the actual diary entries of the participants without ever reducing the narrative to a dry progression of quotes  His ability to bring the harrowing conditions and landscape  the fascinating array of characters  and the grueling sequence of challenges and hairsbreadth escapes into sharp and riveting focus is quite extraordinary  Simon Prebble is a perfect match for the fine writing  He audibly sorts out the personalities involved and presents the whole with an understated but charged clarity which keeps the narrative moving even through what could seem like a never ending and tedious progression of disasters in the voice of a lesser reader Of course the real stars here are Shackleton and the men under his command who prove themselves capable of feats of courage  endurance and simple  stubborn determination which almost surpass belief  Ordinary and flawed in so many ways  they come together to become much more than the sum of their individual qualities In the end  the most fascinating part of this story is the long and torturous series of life and death choices involved  Time after time Shackleton s decisions are crucial to the party s survival  whether the question is when to abandon the pack ice for the boats  when to kill the dogs  when to allow the party to split  or how to get to the bottom of a nearly vertical snowbound precipice in order to avoid freezing at high altitude  think Butch Cassidy and Sundance   Nature is an implacable adversary for these men  marshaling countless terrifying storms  thirst  cold  hunger  completely unpredictable ice and long weeks of winter darkness against them and time after time crushing hope just as it seems most justified  Perhaps the most extraordinary decision of all  under the circumstances  was the choice each of them made to simply keep on keeping on when it seemed to make no senseFinally  while this tale is exhausting in some ways  it is also deeply inspiring and satisfying  And Lansing and Prebble have given us the wonderful opportunity to  experience  it all while sitting in comfort and safety  Almost doesn t seem fair  but I strongly urge you to take advantage of the offer  The title of this book always left me uninterested  But since it was so incredibly popular with kids I decided I should check it out and it is terrific  The narrator captures the spirit of Stanley Yelnats perfectly and you can t turn it off  The ending is a pretty neat and it really illustrates the old cliche  what comes around goes around   I recommend this for young and old alike  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks  like many compelling works of nonfiction  was written to tell one story  but  in its creation  uncovered several others  On the surface  Rebecca Skloot s book is about a line of cells  extracted from a single cancer patient in the 1950s  that went on to be the most widely studied human cell line in the world  On another level  it s about an evolving debate over the medical ethics of cell and DNA ownership  How much say should patients have in the use of their own genetic material  How does society balance the needs of medical research against concerns for privacy and individual autonomy On still another level  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is about race relations in America  about uneven levels of white privilege and black privilege when it comes to access to information and advocacy  It s a story about casual exploitation by a scientific establishment that was trained to compartmentalize and not think of its work in personal terms  Finally  it s a story of a family struggling to find emotional and spiritual closure after the years following the death of their mother  who continues in a strange and somewhat mystifying afterlife If the book had simply been about science and ethical questions pertaining to the cells of Henrietta Lacks  I might not have found it more than mildly interesting  but the human element gives the story many more dimensions  I think Skloot did an excellent and honest job of conveying how one poor  black family from the rural South perceives science and medicine  Of course  they understand and care about the basic things that most Americans do  but their views are colored by a history and identity that  I  a welleducated  middleclass white northerner  simply haven t lived in  It was a fascinating and ultimately hopeful exploration beyond stereotypes and into how human beings really relate to questions that can never be entirely viewed in clinical  medical terms  You get to know Henrietta s extended family  and to view her life and unintended contribution to science as they do Overall  the book felt like an extended episode of This American Life  in that it didnt explore  or resolve  any issue in great depth  but was engagingly put together and taught me a little about a lot of different subjects  Since its not a long read  Id say its welldeserving of its awards and your time  If you re a Neil Gaiman fan  prepare to be surprised by the intimate tone of his latest book  Gaiman s story  magical  remarkable and dark  is perhaps his most revealing work to date As I read this book  I felt Gaiman was sharing bits and bobs of his own childhood  skillfully woven into the fictional narrative  The result was the feeling that I was reading a somewhat biographical account of his own life I will never be able to do justice to this story  All I can say is go read this book and be prepared to laugh  to cry and be given a glimpse into this amazing man s life  In the original epic fantasy trilogy  Mistborn  we were introduced to a roughly eighteen or early nineteenth century dystopian world called Scadrial  It is a world separated into two classes the nobility and the commoners  called the Skaa  The world has several magic systems the most prominent called Allomancy  Allomancy allows users to gain magical powers by swallowing and  burning  specific metals  These users manifest in two forms those who can use one of the Allomantic powers  known as Mistings and those who can use all of the Allomantic powers  known as Mistborn  It was a complex world where the lower class struggled under the subjection of the nobility and the rise of several heroes that attempt to topple the current state of oppression Three hundred years later  after the heros in the first three books had become myths and legends  The Alloy of Law  began and we were introduced to Waxillium Ladrian  known as Wax  hereditary Lord of House Ladrian but also a lawman in the ungoverned frontier region known as the Roughs and a rare Twin born someone that can use two Allomantic powers  In The Allow of Law  the world of Scadrial was on the verge of modernization with railroads and electric lights but the old magics of Allomancy and Feruchemy continued to play a role in the reborn world  This was originally intended as a standalone book but now Brandon Sanderson has decided on a double trilogy yes Now Shadow of Self  continues to follow Wax and his friends  They are now out of the Roughs and back into the urban city  The society is evolving as technology and magic blend  It is a growing democratic civilization with an optimistic economy that is suddenly confronted with urban terrorism and a conspiracy to stop Scadrials progress in its tracks  Wax and his friends must find the culprits responsible before the entire society collapses About the narrator of course Michael Kramers performance is spectacular This series is one of my favorite ever and am looking forward to the next  and final  book  This book started off pretty well  a plausible scenario for a future conflict between two superpowers  However  the book quickly devolves into illexplained science fiction cyber weapons that can completely shut down enemy technology and render systems defenseless  The only solution is for one side to attack the other with WWII technology and rely on the superior cunning of its service members  If you re into that sort of story  this is a good book for you  However  if you re looking for a Tom Clancystyle technothriller with accurate depictions of military technology  I d pass on this one  I just got this audio book a few days ago and am not even all the way through    but have to say If you are a parent  read this book  I am learning so much and can t wait to try out new tips and practices with my children and grandchildren  and maybe even some adults in my life lol   I love the science behind the parenting  facts  we have all been spoonfed     and the reasoning behind why studies are not repeatable and too small  yet guide so many of us in western parenting  The author s heart shows through as she reads her own book aloud   What author recently asks a reader to directly and immediately email them if they somehow come across the wrong way in their intentions to support parents where they are   So many people hire professionals to read their own books  which is great where needed in this case it is really nice to hear her story in her own voice  Can t wait to finish it  and have already recommended this book to others  Who will like this book  If your friends would describe you as highly curious

better sense After you read itSearch YouTube and watch the talk called Greatness Cannot Be Planned  It extends the ideas from this book in a brilliant way If you like the Greatness Cannot Be Planned  then youll also enjoy the following books So Good They Cant Ignore You  Where Good Ideas Come From  and the chapter on the evolution of technology from The Evolution of Everything Also search google for the blog post Focus May Be Your Worst Enemy in Biotech RD  it also resonates with the ideas from this book P S  If youre a curious person  and you probably are because youre looking at books and reading the reviews  definitely get this book P P S  This book is the next Sapiens  The first 12 hours or so of this book were marvelous  I loved learning about trees and their meaning to us and the world around us  by following 7  think     storylines and their interaction with trees  One note was I wished this story could have taken place all over the world instead of just the United States  I feel like that would have been really empowering  One of my favorite parts was learning about a Banyan tree in Laos  however we were only there momentarily because an American pilot fell out of a plane If the book had ended around the middle mark  as seven short stories of people learning how amazing trees can be  it would have been one of my favorite reads in awhile  It did not  It kept going  and going  and going  The group of characters whose stories intertwined became less and less realistic  their decisions and relationships with each other became so entirely unhuman that I couldn t really take any of them seriously  Eventually most of them started truly irritating me  I think this was in part due to the narrators voices for all the characters  while the distinction between each was good  I began associating my distaste for them every time she would speak in their tone The last 7 hours were brutal  Not only because I had started to truly despise half the characters  but I also started to hate myself and all of mankind  I think this was probably the point but the author kept repeating several lines so often that I began to roll my eyes  Yes  I get it  we are destroying the planet by cutting down trees  Yes  I get it  humans are ruining everything  Yes  I get it  humans are hopeless  The end didn t really leave me with much other than being relieved at its being over The one thing I will say is that we  humans  are remarkable creatures too and are capable of doing amazing things  and it s time we put that power and creativity to good use and save our home  I think mankind is capable of living in a sustainable world  we just need to pull our heads out of our butts and make it happen  I wish this book could have given us a little more of that instead of the nothing that  we will destroy our ability to live on this planet  and then we will be gone and the planet will be better for it   Clear  practical advice and insights into optimizing your brains potential  everyday  to achieve your best life  Has a lot of practical small acts with big impacts to help your brain work sharper  Thank you Dr  Gupta for this exceptional book   I loved Cynthia Farrell  but I couldn t get into Deacon Lee  I like enemiestolovers stories  and I liked that this spent more time on the sexual tension and romance between the characters than the sex  Rarely do I find heroines of a romance novel to be truly detestable  So far I can think of one and she did the same thing in that book that Daphne did in this one   rape the hero  The Duke and I started out interesting and engaging but quickly devolved into something disturbing and manipulative  Daphne s actions were not only incongruous with the time period but even by today s accepted behaviors  The only saving grace is the brilliant narration by Rosalyn Landor  I honestly could not finish and thankfully I was able to return it  Now if I could only figure out how to get my time back  As noted in the heading of this review  Bren Brown s work has literally been lifechanging for me  Years ago  my wife was reading  Daring Greatly  and as we were working through some life challenges at the time  she said   I really think you need to read this book   When she confessed that the author was somebody who researched shame and vulnerability  I was like   No thanks   I was convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that I did not need to read about shame and vulnerability After much coaxing  my wife convinced me to begin reading  As I read  Daring Greatly   I honestly couldn t put it down  I quickly ordered  The Gifts of Imperfection  and read through it the following week  I then went back and read it again  slowly  I wanted to absorb some of the principles and practices she communicated  reflect on them  and begin putting some of them into practice myself As her other books came out  I read through them as well  While I wasn t as drawn to  Rising Strong  or  Braving the Wilderness  as I was to the other two  they still provided me with insights that I have come to really hold onto  Having read  and reread all of her work  I recently had a colleague who came to me and said   You ve really changed a lot over the past few years  What steps have you taken to grow so much   My answer   Books by Bren Brown and others   Emotionally Healthy Spirituality  and  Emotionally Healthy Leadership  by the Scazzero s  have been a Godsend  With Dare to Lead  Bren takes on workculture  While many of the same principles have been communicated in her other work  I was thrilled to find some of the best material all compiled together in one book  The material available on the Dare to Lead hub on Bren website made it even better  The workbook and other printouts show that her team doesn t just want to get the information out there  they want to get it out there AND see it put into practice  And for good reason  it needs to be put into practice If you haven t read anything by Bren Brown  this is an excellent start  It s a good summary of some of her former work  and her own narration of the book is exceptional If you re looking for something outside of work culture  then listen to  The Power of Vulnerability   It s 6  roughly 1hour sessions that walk through most of the principles she wrote out in  The Gifts of Imperfection   And it s gold Of the many  many nonfiction books I ve read over the past 20 years of my life  Bren s books are seriously at the top of my list  She s done very important research on topics nobody else wants to talk about and the results give us input as to why we need to be talking about these things Seriously  if you re still reading this  pick up Dare to Lead  or Power of Vulnerability  asap  Listen to it more than once  Take notes  Challenge yourself  Put some new skills into practice  It ll change how you see yourself  and how you see others   in the best way possible  What did you love best about The Secret Code of Success  I absolutely loved this memoir  I also enjoy when the author narrates on Audible and Yusef did not disappoint  This was a moving  gut wrenching  heartbreaking  yet inspirational story of a personal  inside look at a young man s life affected by the injustices of our  justice  system  I wasn t even born yet when this court case was in the news and media  I learned  for the first time  through Yusef s memoir what happened to him and the other exonerated men  This was a beautiful way to rewrite the narrative  My generation will now read the truth through Yusef s memoir  watch the truth on Netflix s  When They See Us   and advocate for the truth to continue to be told  The more I listened to Yusef s story the more captivated I was  the more I wanted to hear about his experiences  the more I wanted to help  This book completely moved me  I highly  highly suggest reading it  Thank you  Yusef  for sharing your truth and for discussing memories that were so difficult to bring back to the surface  You are changing this world for the better  Absolutely incredible  If youre looking for actual WAYS to get ahead in your finances  this book is not for you Jen is excellent at the mind game money plays  Theres a whole lot of thought process and money mantra but no real  hard advice for how she built wealth Except for borrowing 85k from a friend to then pay an expert to tell her how to get ahead Im glad this only cost me 1 audible credit  This was my first Isaac Asimov  It seemed to be one of his most acclaimed works which is why I wanted to hear it  Listened at 1 6x speed I guess that its generally true most scifi ages badly and this is a good example  Set 12000 years in the future where civilization has spread throughout the galaxy yet they are writing a book on paper and the kind of money most people care about is gold coins Theyre supposed to be writing an encyclopedia about the entire history of mankind but theyve forgotten the human race started on earth  They have atomic power plants that explode like atomic bombs  atomic spaceships  atomic shields and atomic ray guns  Technology has not advanced much since the 1950s The plot about a collapsing empire is nothing extraordinary nor even interesting in 2020  given current world events  Time in the book passes so fast that new characters appear and then die of old age a couple of chapters later  You dont even have a chance to get emotionally attached to them Maybe this was the first of its kind when it first came out  but unless you have some special appreciation for this fact  theres nothing for you in this book if youve read any modern scifi  Excellent and imaginative  a really interesting view of what the human mind is capable of if given time  And how politics  Religious views and fanaticism can easily destroy a civilization  loved the narrator  loved the story until the last minute are you serious with this semicliffhanger  by the time the next audible book comes out  will I even remember this       this is the book for you This book is spellbinding  I couldnt stop listening once I hit play  The writing style is excellent  the characters are likable  most of them  and believable and the plot is actually quite unique  I would go into the storyline but the publishers summary gives more than enough information  almost too much  There are some surprising twists that I didnt see coming and the ending is close to impossible to figure out until its revealed Be warned  there are some graphic assault scenes which can be difficult to listen to and might offend some people The narration is excellent and the two narrators worked very well together This book has my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank You  loved everything  I couldn t stop listening  Helped me understand mechanisms within myself and within my partner  showed me how to straighten a few things out  the book really shed light on the polarization aspect of a relationship and the necessity of union through difference and individualization  highly recommend  make your life better  apply the wisdom in these pages  The story was beautiful  heart wrenching  and fully identifiable  It was funny  sharp  and poignant  Narration  well done The only reason I gave the overall category 4 stars was due to the sex scenes I wish would have been fadetoblack closeddoor  I assumed the earlier interruptions to passionate moments meant the story WOULD fade out when sex was nigh  and when it didntwell    just not my thing That being said    the first sex scenethe only one I listened to entirelywhile too graphic for my personal reading listening preferences was     relatively  tastefulish   cringe In my opinion  the onscene sex scenes were    unnecessaryat least in the breadth and scope in which they were written  This author is amazing  and I have no doubt she could have portrayed the same tender passion without that vivid content  In my opinion  take it or leave it  because everyone has their own threshold  the admittedly excellent story would have been  if not STRONGER  of equal strength and beauty without that level of descriptive physical intimacy on the page  I was grateful for the 30 second jumpahead feature when the subsequent rounds began  and used it  But dang    I had to push that button a lot to get to the other side Please note This is a phenomenally welltold story  with fully realized characters that made me laugh and made me ache  I  will  likely read or listen to it again  skimming over or skipping through the things I do not wish to read hear    now that I know where they are I hate having to selectively withhold my recommendation of such an otherwise brilliant book like this  or having to mention a content warning to certain people audiences who would otherwise love the story but for the scope of the portrayal of physical intimacy  But    I will  Reading preferences are subjective  and some content can shock those not ready for it  What would have made The LifeChanging Magic of Tidying Up better  This is one of the best told stories I have encountered either in print or as an audible offering  Hillenbrand goes beyond a strict narrative of wartime experiences and transports us into the lives of people we will never know  but feel that we do  Over and over I found myself literally praying for the safety and rescue of Louis and his colleagues  even though obviously the outcomes were decided over 60 years ago  the sense of immediacy was ever present  Intensively researched  the attention to detail successfully avoids the sense of being drowned in statistics  but allows the awareness of  Man  I never knew that   Adding to the story telling experience is Edward Herrmann s flawless reading  I have been strongly recommending this book to all of my friends  one does not have to be a history buff or a fan of war stories to recognize and appreciate the humanity at the center of the story  Anyone who can be inspired by personal courage and perserverance will enjoy this book  Yes  this book should be required reading for any medical professional of any kind who may ever have to help any patient make good decisions for themselves and their families against terminal or very debilitating illness  It should otherwise be read by well  anyone  We are all going to die  We either need to know what expectations to give those around us for those end times  either family or medical professionals or we need to know how best to guide our loved ones through the process of the end of their lives  because it will happen for all of us  Past that  this is a remarkably entertaining read  Oh  the parts about the history of nursing homes and assisted living made me yawn  but the rest had me spell bound  Dr  Gawnde s accounting of his own father s illness and death left me awash in emotion and even tears  The narration was perfect  This is probably one of the best books Ive ever read  It was deeply moving and I didnt want it to end  One of things Im left with is how devastating slavery was and its lingering effects are still with us  The voice actor does a pretty good job as well  I also have the Kindle version but I prefer the narration  You have to really pay attention Chapter to chapter to how the characters are connected to each other or you will be lost  the book itself has a great story  great and interesting characters  but it s an eye opener and the most  is life changing  on business and in life  I am definitely willing to read listing to more books like this one  I ve read this book several times and enjoyed the HBO series  so my expectations were quite high with this audiobook  Do not be put off by reviews that are dismissive of the narration  Tim Jerome s sober narration is entirely appropriate for this powerful work of nonfiction  I am not an IT guy but a blue collar worker  There is a lot of understanding of processes that translate to everything in the business field I would recommend this to everyone who is in any business  It gives good examples of work and problem solving Take a chance and listen to  or read this book Wild at Heart was dropped into my hand at a time of personal crisis  My life was upside down and inside out  Having walked with the Lord for 27 years I had answers to many of the questions that we  as men  ask oursevles  Yet some of the most important questions had gone unanswered or worse were never really asked John carefully and successfully opened up my heart as no other man has  excpet Jesus  and delivered Healing  Understanding and Passion His writing style is personal and easy  I highly recommend Wild at Heart  I love this series and I love the MC  this is well written hits all the things you want in a good book  The performance by Travis Baldree as always was amazing  this entire book feels like an epilogue to nemesis games I really wanted this book  I was looking forward to it  but after the last book I didn t enjoy this one nearly as much  too much is just about clean up  and it doesn t really go anywhere  you have to read it though to see where the story is going  80  of this book is worldbuilding or laying the foundation for the next book   or cleaning up the aftermath of the last book  I m still excited about where this story can go  Just wish this book would have been better  We don t spend enough time with characters that you care about  lots of new characters that you don t have as much of an investment with  Bobby is back but not used in the way you want her to be  I could say more but again the main point is that this is a book that she gets through to get to the next one which I hope will be great  I m giving this 4 stars instead of 3 only because the storyline is good    but damn  she could have cut about four hours off the run time without the repetitive and overly detailed sex scenes  I don t mind a couple steamy scenes like we had in the first book  but when there are well over half a dozen and each one uses the exact same language over and over  you can just go with       and we all get the point  I started skipping them halfway through so I didn t have to listen to the narrator talk about  her very core  or  that bundle of nerves  one more time  Three of the yummiest Brentwood baseball players in one convenient box set  Yes  please  Knox  Carson  and Jasons stories are three of my favorite guys from the Meghan Quinn world In the Locker Room  we meet Knox and Emory  Theyre a force to be reckoned with  Knox is a sweet Southern gentleman who stole my heart with his kindness  And I loved Emory with her selflessness  This audio was performed by Rock Engle and Felicity Monroe  I loved them for Knox and Emory  they were the perfect choice The Dugout gutted me  I was in tears over Carsons story  It was such a heartfelt story  I loved Carson and Milly  Carson broke my heart  His story was utterly heartbreaking and I was sobbing for him  And Milly  I just loved her so much  She spoke to my soul and I related to her so much  The nerdy girl whos shy but loves sports and her friends  Unsure of herself but is super close with a few people and her family  This was one of Sebastian Yorks best performances  You could feel the emotion he put into it  Savannah Peachwood was amazing as Milly and portrayed her perfectly And I cannot forget the Lineup  Jason is my favorite of the bunch  The goofy  burly catcher with the heart and soul of gold  An amazing overall guy who should be what future guys are modeled after  And hes one dirty talking alpha too  That was a very happy surprise  Dottie was also a favorite  A strong  independent woman who knew what she wanted and was not afraid to go after it  But she was also vulnerable with Jason  These two seriously made my heart happy  And I could not stop laughing  Jason and his one liners were hilarious  Stephen Dexter and Maxine Mitchell were absolute perfection  The perfect choices for Jason and Dottie  Ive read hundreds of business  financial and selfhelp books over the years and this has quickly become one of my favorites  Its straightforward  NO B S advise on creating wealth FAST The core message is essentially the same as the book RichDad PoorDad with a few minor differences  Both books assert if you want to be rich do what rich people do  Rich people focus on purchasing income producing assets that over time allow them to stop trading their time for money and get out of the ratrace RichDad says it like this  p58  If you want to be rich  this is all you need to know  Rule1 You must know the difference between an asset and a liability and buy assets  It is Rule 1 and is the only rule  Rich people acquire assets  The poor and middle called acquire liabilities FastLane says it like this p123  The primary wealth accelerant of the rich boils down to one concept Appreciable and controllable assets  Slowlaners and side walkers buy and sell depreciating assets that decline in value over time  Fastlaners buy and sell appreciating assets businesses  brands  cash flows  notes  intellectual property  licenses  inventions  patents and real estate  A few of my favorite chapters wereChapter 14  The hypocrisy of gurus  which he explains how most financial gurus didn t get rich on the advise they teach  They got rich selling the slow lane idea to consumers while getting rich in the fast lane Chapter 17  Switch Teams and Playbooks  which he explains the need to switch mindsets from a consumer to a producer in order to build wealth I also love the author s idea of wealth  Its not about the money  Real wealth is in freedom  relationships and healthTowards the end the author begins to dig into the practical howto stuff  Providing tips on getting your business started  what business to go into  pitfalls to avoid  how to recognize business opportunities everywhere and things you ll need to learn to be successful There is a ton of value in this book  Repetitive at times   YES  Entirely way to long 325pages    YES      A CLASSIC book that every entrepreneur should read   YES   Tony Rogers JrAuthor of VisionaryMaking a difference in a world that needs YOU The book is a combination of an autobiography and entrepreneurial advice  The first three chapters are about the author s start in the business  as if he s a recognizable name in the tech industry   Few people probably even heard of the companies that he cofounded  Loudcloud and Opsware  Also  it was selfindulgent of the author to start each chapter with a quotation from rap music  reciting lyrics from Kanye West as if they were words of wisdom to a businessperson  When the author finally gets to recounting the struggles of running a company and giving advice on how to avoid the mistakes he made  the book then starts to fulfill its intent of  Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers   The author described the actions he had taken and explained his thought process  He gave the  what    how   and  why  for his actions  Many of the suggestions are specific to entrepreneurs  like hiring an executive team  how to run a startup company  and when to sell the company   There is some business management advice  like having regular 1on1 meetings with direct reports and giving clear  honest feedback   but you ll have to prod through a lot of the entrepreneurial content  This book  the techniques taught have tremendously improved my well being  I was raised in a highly critical environment  where I was criticized for which movie I watched  because I had already seen it before   which sport I wanted to play  because I didn t have natural ability   and more recently  going back to graduate school   your life will be better if you stay in your job    I internalized this criticism and I have dealt with depression and anxiety for the majority of my life  By relating to myself with compassion  I am happier because I now know am not at fault for every struggle in my life  I am also more resilient because I do not attack myself  get caught in a negative spiral when I make mistakes  I am more productive in my work and more present for my life I wish I had learned these techniques as a 12yearold  but I am so glad to have learned them now  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a negative dialogue inside their mind on a regular basis  I am grateful for Kristen Neff s work  Very enjoyable SLOW BURN  Loved the writing style and the story line  The characters were fun and realistic and the love story was sweet  Very light on sex and the one sex scene is very PG  The narration is not bad  It would have been better as a dual narration  What made the experience of listening to Wonder the most enjoyable  Would you listen to The Ideal Team Player again  Why  There are audiobooks and there are GREAT audiobooks  This is a GREAT audiobook    After hundereds of audiobooks  only Nelson Demille s  The Gold Coast  is in the same class  I resisted listening to The Kite Runner for a long time due to the fact I thought a setting based in Afganastan just wasn t my cup of tea  I could not have been more wrong  The plight of Amir and Hassan is a story I ll not soon forget  The book is very well written and the pronuciation by the author made the book feel even more alive  It was an emotional rollacoaster I loved and as the book ended I cried  All I can keep saying is  For You a Thousand Times Over   This book was amazingly raw  I loved it and I love Tiffany even more I NEVER revisit an audiobook but as soon as Im done telling you how amazing this book was Im going to restart it all over again  I got this book up on a friends recommendation but I was not moved by the title  There seemed to be other things that I wanted to get to first  When checking in with that friend  hes a consultant  about an upcoming meeting he mentioned a story in the book  so I began listening  I was hooked  I like the framework and the stories that show the framework in practice  Beyond the workvalue of this book  I am excited about putting these ideas into practice for my family  making memories  I have always felt a barrier between Christ and myself  The desire to connect has always been there  but I ve always had so much doubt  However  I have never taken the time to check the facts for myself  I ve leaned all too heavy in my misunderstandings  This book called to me  and I m glad I answered  It has impacted me  and I ll never be the same  For that  I am grateful  Take this book for what it is a fun fantasy adventure  It s not excessively cerebral  and it s not excessively complex  A well constructed fantasy world that feels pretty large and typically engrossing  The series takes itself seriously enough to make risky moments feel dangerous  but remains lighthearted enough that it retains the feeling of adventure captured in the earlier novels  It s that feeling of lighthearted adventure  preserved through tragedy  war  and nearly the end of the world itself  that makes Robinson s novels feel so refreshing  Though the storyline feels progressively more and more bleak  the lighthearted camaraderie makes the journey feel unencumbered despite the dire circumstances  In a time where fantasy adventure is nearly always accompanied by extremely prolific violence and mature content  a puritan focus on fantasy adventure  unencumbered by adult content for its own sake  imparts a feeling of genuine nostalgia for fantasy novels I read as a child  I m grateful for the read  and the author has my heartfelt thanks for writing novels that never fail to brighten my days  Perfect narration  So happy that chose this version of the bookHis voice finds it s way into your head  Trust me  I have been an audible member for over twelve years  This is the first time I have felt compelled to offer a review This book is a masterpiece  As the author notes  this is not a comprehensive history  What it is is an incredible character study into several individuals connected to the IRA This book will stick with me for a long time  Great story and I took so much away from this book  Will make me a happier person and a better leader  I think the only thing that could make this book better would be a complementary drop of acid on the corner of the last page  I didn t know this was released by a Christian publisher  and if I had known I might not have bought it  in spite of loving Kim and Penn s videos   I am so glad I didn t know because it is fabulous  with insights that apply to improving all relationships  Towards the end there was a story about a fight starting right before a Christmas pageant  but that s it  No biblical tales  no preaching  nothing about religion  In my mind  that makes this book accessible to all  Excellent  hilarious reading by the authors  I laughed and learned  Thanks guys  Have to start with the narration  which was almost an immediate deal breaker for me  Super robotic  but I think it actually compliments Ferns character FERN    Who wouldnt love this sweet  sensory overloaded  quirky woman  However  it is short  really too short  and I feel cheated in a way  The only true redeeming quality is Fern  I love a mystery with this type of setting  snowy with murders and stranded guests  The story was quite good  but  as another reviewer has noted  the reveal was underwhelming  I was also confused by the epilogue  the author throwing suspicion on some unknown person who might be involved  Sometimes there are too many red herrings  At any rate  it s a good  atmospheric mystery performed by one of the best  Elizabeth Knowelden  What did you love best about New Moon  Would you consider the audio edition of Alexander Hamilton to be better than the print version  This series is set during the years following WWII  In Book 2 of the Archer series by David Baldacci Archer moves to coastal California to work for a more experienced private investigator  Along the way he meets an aspiring actress and singer who travels with him and becomes his love interest  Once in California he takes on a case that centers on a local political campaign  Dead bodies start to mount as Archer investigates the case THE GAMBLING MAN is an outstanding suspense thriller with a very likable protagonist  Narration is stellar  I love Sunny an thought her memoir was one of thr best books I ve ever read right up there with Michelle Obama book  In the book I don t think she focused on one character enough rather on all of them too quickly  I wasn t able to fall in love with any of them bc I didn t get to know them  It was very descriptive but with useless details way too many people way too fast it felt like she rushed It to get to the main story  but the story itself was too big as in too many complicated variables so hard to follow along not relaxing it felt like work trying to keep up  I think Ama needed her own book  I smiled through this entire book  I knew Id love the book  I love all CL books  but I didnt expect this book to be one of my favorites  The characters and storyline were both unique and heartfelt  I wish I didnt finish it so quickly  I have had this book in print format since 1990 and have probably read it at least 15 times  It has always made me feel better when I was a little depressed and I have been waiting for it to come to Audible US even since I saw it on the British Audible website  www audible co uk   It is a wonderfully funny book with much to say about what we call  the human condition  and I love it  but I feel I should warn potential readers that the humor is decidedly British  When my sister read this book her comment was that she thought it was trying to be funny  but she kept missing the point of the jokes  So while I strongly recommend this book  that recommendation is mostly aimed at those who understand and appreciate British humor I have only one complaint about the way this book was read  Martin Jarvis should have paid more attention to those places in the book where line spacing was used to separate different threads of the story  Normally readers  when coming across those kind of breaks  supply their own silence to let listeners know that a different story thread is picking up  but Mr  Jarvis often runs directly from one thread to another without supplying any audio indication that the story line was changing  This is a minor point  but I found it annoying at times With the above caveats I heartily recommend this book to any Neal Gaiman or Terry Pratchett readers  my children   ages 8  5  3  love audio books  The magic tree house was wonderful for all three  my three year old would even sit quietly when I stated the book  My two older kids loved the storylines  and the magic and mystery  I am so glad we started this series and I look forward to the next set  I really enjoyed this book  As a matter of fact  the minute I finished  I started it over and listened to it again  just in case I missed anything the first time through  I got totally caught up in the fantasy world that was very credible  I think it is the hallmark of excellent fantasy to pull the reader into a willing suspension of disbelief  and Neverwhere certainly did that for me  This story was a vacation into another culture and land without ever leaving my own chair  Thanks for the trip  I am 11 years old and I absolutely love this bookThe narrating in this book is amazing kudos to the narrator Jim Dale each character has a different voice  and of course the story is very enjoyable and that goes for all the books by J  K  Rowling I don t usually buy an audiobook when I ve already read the kindle version of a novel  and even less often do I actually listen to it when I do  but The Endgame was simply one of my favorite books this year and I HAD to have it  And I wasn t disappointedI mean  I knew I wouldn t be  since I know and like Iggy Toma and  as I already said  I was a HUGE fan of the novel I m a sucker for a good comingout book  but good examples of that are few and far between  Too often they are written by people who have no idea what it s like to come out or even to be gay in the first place   I never even knew I liked guys until I met you   is a sentence that virtually nobody has ever uttered in the history of the world  and yet somehow it s one of the most common refrains you ll hear in books about  coming out   quotation marks intended  So imagine my delight when not one  but THREE excellent books about coming out were released at the same time  this one   Concealed Hearts  by Nicky James  and  The Jock  by Tal Bauer   I ll also pick up the other two when and if they re released on audio This book focuses on the relationship between a closeted gay American football player  Anson  and a very noncloseted US senator  Weston  A senator  you say  Well yes  but the author really  really doesn t focus on that part  Don t worry that the story is going to get bogged down with politics  Actually  making West a senator is one of the very few missteps the book makes  because it s mentioned so seldom and has so little effect on the plot  But no matter  this is Anson s book  and Hart knocks it out of the park with him  yes  I m aware that s a baseball metaphor  not football   Loyal  brave  and true  Anson embodies everything positive about masculinity  Hart also appears to actually like sports and jocks  since unlike a lot of books which center around athletes  she doesn t treat them with utter contempt  West is also a good character  simply for the fact that he never pushes Anson into coming out before he s ready  something that a deserving partner would never  ever do  Secondary characters include Anson s brother Elias  his best friend and teammate Darren  Darren s sister Mia  and others  and they re all their own fully fleshedout characters with personalities and backstories Iggy Toma is a fantastic narrator  but that s pretty much a given he s very consistent  He has a pleasant cadence  he sounds appropriately masculine  and  importantly for a romance novel  he doesn t rush and get awkwardly breathless during sex scenes unlike a few overused narrators in this genre  I ll easily give him five stars for his performance  though I have to confess I m slightly disappointed that this wasn t a dual narration  since Anson and Weston are such different people and Toma only really has one character voice  though it s a good one Anyway  this one is highly recommended  and comes during a m m drought  so it s even more of a blessing  I haven t always been a fan of Riley Hart but this one is a homerun  er  I mean a touchdown  Although I like Billie Eilish  this is simply a book about doting parents talking about their little girl  No different than any other loving parents  I thought there was going to be something different  but it was just a regular story about a regular girl who became famous and is a great singer  Story was nothing out of the ordinary  What a great book  and the authors performance was incredible  Sometimes thought provoking but always entertaining  I highly recommend this book  Ive always enjoyed his acting  but what a pleasant surprise to learn that he is not just a talented actor  but also a man with a remarkable depth of passion for his art  his family and his friends  His narration is top notch  I absolutely love this series and am very sad the next 4 are not on audible  the 2 novellas 5 5 and 7 5  and the novels 6 and 7  The narrator is by far my favorite narrator  She does such an amazing job bringing the books to life  Ive always been on the fence about Gabriel  this book changed my mind  She was raw and authentic and her insight and approach to life now based on her experiences are refreshing  Great read This is my favourite type of classic  It is an exciting and thoroughly believable story coupled with a great writing style and profound themes that really resonate  Its full of action  suspense  hope  fear  love  caring  pride  humility  and insight  I was very impressed and my first thought when I finished the book was I have got to share this with my sons I listened to this classic from start to finish uninterrupted on a long airplane flight  Doing that was a mistake  though  I was cheating myself  For a short book  there is a heck of a lot packed in and its messages are presented quite subtly  Without time to reflect on what I d just read  I  rightly  suspected I d missed quite a bit  So  the day after finishing it  I undertook a bit of research to see what themes I had missed  Im glad I did and now have a much better appreciation of this fine novella  I suggest you do the same if you get a similar feeling when you finish it And no surprise Donald Sutherland s narration is thoroughly enjoyable and worthy of this great book  At some points in the book it becomes mesmerizing  Always watch Neil deGrasse Tyson when he is a guest on a late night talk show  The 10 minute segments always seem so easy to understand  This book  though  is way past my scientific knowledge and there is not enough ampquotsimplificationampquot in his explanations  Many parts are still very interesting  but this is one book where having some science in your background will be very helpful  The title is actually kind of misleading  it seems like it s only for a small group of people who suffer from anxiety  But this book is much bigger  I can t see how everyone wouldn t benefit from this book  It s such straightforward good advice  advice you would have gotten from a loving parent had this parent also been a wise counselor  During each book  I grieved this ending  I didnt want Lia and Adrians story to end  I loved them SO much  But they had the ending of all endings  without a spoiler There were so many awesome things happening  So many questions answered  so many smiles from me  The sex was even hotter  the family was getting even happier  I loved that Lia protected Adrian just as much as Adrian protected her  They were a match made in pure heaven  I am still trying to decide if I like Lia s epilogue better than Adrians epilogue  SO  SO  SO  GOOD  I even caught myself smiling at that little  papa  comment  Gahhh  I could not recommend this more if I tried  My only gripe is that I read it when it came out and now I have to wait until winter for book 2  As a big fan of 1920 murders mysteries  this should be right up my alley  However  I found the main character Eleanor really really frustrating  to the point that sometimes the secondhand embarrassment I experienced while listening was so intense that I had to turn it off  Its one thing to be take charge and direct  its another thing to be childishly impulsive with no plan and just a lot of unfounded smack talk  Illinois did not feel at all like a grown woman who had experienced a lot in her life  she felt like a clueless teenager trying to pretend she was an adult I was bedazzled and enchanted by this novel  and I enjoyed the fairly lowkey narration of the audiobook  I have no need to repeat what knowledgeable reviewers have said regarding the quality and impact of The Goldfinch  I do have a personal comment on just one thing  and it has to do with the production  not the book itself After immersing myself completely in the 32 hours of its reading  allowing the author s craft to lead me along  inch by inch  to the very moving conclusion  my savoring of the last words was shattered by the sudden intrusion of a ridiculous crescendo of music  as though  after all that brilliant writing  I needed help  feeling  the book  What an insult to the art of writing and the intelligence and sensitivity of the reader  I m going to be wandering into a local bookstore soon just to read those last words to myself  in silence  free from the influence of any marketing expert s illconceived attempt to program my reactions to them  Audible  feel free to be frivolous with frivolous books  but please  let serious works of fiction stand on their merits they need no heavyhanded assistance in performing their magic  I loved almost all of the financial advice given in this book  I will now go and buy a physical copy of it to reference for years to come  I wasnt a big fan of the audio version though  for a few reasons 1  The information needs to be readily available for reference  I need to highlight things and be able to go back and forth in the book  2  There are a LOT of numbers be cited  Percentages and dollar amounts that dont register as well when being read to you  You need to see them to be able to process them better  3  Most audio books are listened to while doing other tasks  driving  exercising  etc  I feel like this book needs your full attention  Your finances and future wealth should warrant more than just background noise with a good story  You need to take notes  look up things  etc  Overall  fantastic book    But get a physical copy  you will get more from it  The story was a good one with solid characters and a touching plot  What was incredibly distracting was the narrator  When she was reading normally  it was easy to follow along but when she would try to do different voices  I had to almost ALWAYS replay that part  I even slowed the speed down at one point to try to understand  It just became something that interfered with the story far more than it should have  Although this book tends to focus on those forced into a nomadic lifestyle by financial hardships and my story is much different as I had no real worried is my static life as my home and car were both paid off in full  I can relate with these stories because at heart I have and will always be a nomad  While yes as many of the people in the book are introverts  as am I  we are all searching for happiness in our lives  As I can relate to the stories of wanting to be alone at times I also have that desire to be around like minded people  Which this book does a great job of showing This book is not a collection of sob stories none of these people want you to feel sorry for them  but however a collection of survival stories  Living a nomadic lifestyle is by no means easy  but for those of us who choose to continue living the lifestyle it is truly the freest form of living there is  I have never experienced stealth camping as well I live in a 39 foot RV with a 12 foot trailer behind it so stealth isnt really an option for me  I do understand the fear of getting the dreaded knock when pulled over for a night at a truck stop or rest area As for calling us homeless  that we are not we go home every night and sleep in our beds  cook on our stoves  for those of us lucky enough to have the shower in our own showers  The only difference from us and those in static home is ours has wheels  For the most part we all still contribute to society we travel from job to job much like a long haul trucker  The only difference is that our jobs only last 35 months on average then we move to the next one  So next time you all see one of us out there at a Walmart or anywhere else for that matter stop and say hi  we wont ask for money as a matter of fact you may get a good story of your own to tell  This is the second copy of this audiobook title that I purchased from Audible  This newer version is read by the author  Scott Adams  While I ve listened to the first version of this book numerous times and felt it was very well narrated  this version  which is read by the author  feels like a completely different book  Since I already listen to a lot of Scott s content on YouTube  his voice is very familiar to me and I found that I paid more attention to the content of this audiobook  In fact  I heard tons of things that I dont even remember hearing in the first version  So  if you already have the earlier version of this audiobook  expect to hear this in a completely new way  This was definitely a five star listen  give it a try you won t be disapointed funny full of action and great narator Took a flyer on a new title  This is one that I m going to keep I m liking the the character development  We see  at least somewhat  believable characters who have moments of insensitivity  moments of apology  and who grow  We have a goodnatured protagonist  23 years old  male  Australian  with lots of personality  perhaps fitting some Australian character tropes  I like the way that interactions between teammates are handled I m liking the worldbuilding  Our character has entered a new world  While I do read books with intense worldbuilding  this one has a deft touch  Cities and locations are described in an accessible level of detail  enough to picture the locations without being swamped with details Although this is a LitRPG  we really and truly are not inundated with lists of stats  The character receives a new ability  It s named  and that s about it  up until we need to learn more about it  We see sections of his character sheet when they are relevant  we re not inundated with character sheet reviews  It s quite refreshing I think the narration s truly great  It s a good performance  easy to listen to  with characters coming to life This is well above average for the genre  a book full of personality  4 5 to 5 stars  The story is well written and voice acted well  CP has really matured in his ability to spin a story and world I was captivated and anxious to get to the next word  However  the story leans into tropes of horror and uses strong language suitable only for mature audiences  I was taken back by the first fword  less than an hour in  and they didnt stop coming after that  I dont prefer horror  but I would have tolerated the mild language and horror tropes  so far  without such frequent and strong language  I just dont need that kind of content I really looked forward to reading this book by one of my favorite authors  However  I have returned it  I originally borrowed this audiobook from the library to see if I d actually make the recipes in it  I ended up using the cookbook all the time so I committed to buying it  Love the recipes and pix  Everything is delicious    Elizabeth Gilbert can write  this is undeniable  Many passages in this book are elegantly written and bring forth detailed images in your mind of the stories that she s telling unfortunately most of the actual content is painfully simplistic she draw simplistic conclusions such as   being creative is hard but you should do it anyway   She often reinforces her point with long lists of explanatory terms which ultimately feel somewhat insulting as if I didn t get the idea from the first example    The chapter about tricksters just made me angry the examples went on for such a long time  it also felt a lot like she couldn t quite decide whether to write a book about how to write a book  or whether to write a book about creativity  iIt s pretty muddy whether this is actually focusd on writing as a creative outlet or if it s more broadly aimed at creativity in general in the end  I feel like I know Elizabeth Gilbert much better than I did before I started  but I don t feel like I have any greater access to my own creativity or to an understanding of the creative process than I did before  You know the drill  Too many choices makes spending your next credit difficult  Some time ago I started searching for new listens based on good narrators  That s how I stumbled upon this title Another review said this book reminded them of Star Trek and other Earth future Sci Fi  I tend to agree  I also like the level of detail in regards to the technology Its only early in the series and I can feel the story arcs developing  enough that I ll try the second installment  I ll be looking for more character development  There s some  but there needs to be more in my view  Having said that  its enjoyable and feels to be going somewhere However  be warned  Rosone is a Musk fan boy  I did think about stopping right when I first heard a reference  but pettiness is unbecoming someone older than 5 D This Is Agatha at her best  Very intriguing  very wicked   but I m not sure I would have enjoyed it nearly as much with a lesser narrator I knew Dan Stevens was a good actor  but I had no idea he was a GREAT actor  Clearly he has worked on his voice and vocal characterisations so much so that he has become incredibly facile and believable as so many diverse characters in this book  I might go so far as to say he is the best I have ever heard This was worth a credit  even though I got it on sale  In love with this audio book     the person reading it and the content     so many stories or scenarios I ve already went thru my daughter and made me laugh so much    I used one of examples when I had to continuously ask my daughter to work in her school work  and grades    finally told her I ve given you all the tools to succeed and always will be here  but you are responsible for going to schoool  getting your work done  and getting good grades  It s your responsibility not mine     it HELPED    this book is an amazing guide to what teens bring to the table    Thanks for such a well written book     I never write reviews as you might be able to tell  but just wanted other parents to know that it helped me in so many ways    thanks      Thank you for being the perfect teacher at the perfect time    I am forever changed by this new journey  Really loved the book  Narration was great  loved the unflinching honesty  Really recommend it   Probably will listen to again   Well the story itself is well written and engaging  it was very heart wrenching  This is not something that I was expecting from the description or the beginning of the book  It was not what I was in the mood for  If you are looking for something happy and to brighten your day  this would not be it Been wanting to read this book for years  Now that it is finished  I m a little let down  Embrace change  Yup    completely agree  Looking for more insight  Like I said  this is a good book But if you have already accepted change as a part of life  this may not offer much substance past that notion  And this one by far was the most interesting to me in terms of cases  One thing about his books   he always takes the first 3 chapters or so   about 2 hours   talking about his background that gets tedious and Ill be honest  I usually skip those chapters  This one is no different and even with the loss of the first hour or so  I would still recommend this for the really   juicy  detailed and interesting cases that after his initial bio   seems to be back to back for the next ten hours Great book  Im hard to please and I really liked this one a lot  When I first read The Last Wish it was purely on a whim  I saw it was on sale and bought it  I was interested after that collection of short stories  so I bought Blood of Elves  I finished it quickly and came to the conclusion that it was a very strong first novel of the actual series  Therefor I had to get The Time of Contempt  and it far outshown my expectations  The beginning of the novel is a bit slow  but after the first couple of hours the novel takes off at a breakneck pace  Everything about this book is intriguing  whether it be the intricate characters  the deceptively complex plot  or the well crafted world  I think my favorite part of the book was the plot  whitch really made me think to try and determine who was on who s side  By the end of the book  I can honestly say I am beautifully confused and excited for the next novel  I must comment that the ending is a bit strange and unexpected  but I need to read the next book to properly judge  The one flaw I started to notice about this book are the character names  There are many characters in this book and their names are extremely complex and hard to keep straight  I can attribute this to the book being written by a Polish author though and I really didn t have that much of a problem  it is just a slight issue  Despite this book being fantastic I must admit that one of the best parts was the narrator  He has a beautiful voice that is perfect for storytelling  especially this kind of story  I highly recommend this book  it is well worth the time and money  Peter Kenny lends a mesmerizing voice to Geralt  Though through the series there has been strange changes at times between intonation of names and certain voices  ie Dandelion   his rendition of Geralt is superb  With such a masterful performance  it makes playing the Video Game version awkward  as Kenny s simply puts it to shame  If youre familiar with a 12 step program  particularly AlAnon  much of the information will not be brand new to you  However  the way it is presented is fantastic  This is very easy to understand  with actual things you can do  examples of what to say  and a concise summary of every important message and any other selfhelp book has stated  Highly recommended if you feel anxious  overwhelmed  resentful  or otherwise feel you could be happier and life could be better I ve listened to several Michael Connelly audiobooks  and love the Harry Bosch series  I was excited to see several more recently become available on Audible The Concrete Blonde is my current favorite Bosch book  topping my previous favorite Echo Park It s an outstanding mix of courtroom thriller and serial killer hunt police procedural  It moves along quickly  even the courtroom scenes are fast paced Characters are very well developed  not just Bosch  but all the supporting characters  and I like the plot Bosch is sued for unlawful killing of a serial killer suspect  while at the same time a copycat killer is out there and more bodies begin to show up Just when you think you have it all figured out  there will be a couple twists at the end to keep you guessing  An excellent whodunnit  I highly recommend this book  even if it is your first Harry Bosch mystery  What a Ride  Great character development  Exciting  nail biting action  Sound science  Bobby Akart really does his homework  Can t wait to find out what comes next  Love Kevin Pierce s narration  loved it  I do need more such a strong story and a romantic one at that i dowloaded the book series 14 for my 14 tr  old granddaughter  so i listened to them to make sure they were OK  i am 58 and the grandpa  the first one was a bit slow for me but i could see the interest points for the kids  the 2nd gained a bit of momentum  the 3rd and 4th hit homeruns  i really enjoyed the whole series  Great story progression  I truly enjoyed the pacing of the story  The characters are dynamic and diverse and the narration is top notch  A wonderful story and a wonderful experience  What did you like best about Simplicity Parenting  What did you like least  As usual Mr  Gladwell has impressive insights  This time he looks at the power of  thin slicing  which is essentially making a snap judgment about something  The key to that blink reaction being accurate though has much to do with the observers expertise in an area  you need to have some  and the context in which they are making the determination  you need to have a neutral  unbiased way to make the judgment or it may be unavoidably affected   The premise of this sounded good to me  but if Ive said it once  Ive said it a thousand times  blah blah   Mary Calmes and I have a volatile relationship  Whether or not I like one of her books depends on how frustrated I am with her MCs and the common theme with them seemingly perfect  loved by everyone heroes that are completely clueless in the most asinine ways  Also  the level of ridiculousness surrounding the MCs plays a part  as well  I can count on one hand the number of her books I would consider revisiting and still have a finger or two left  But this book  I am 100 impressed  While the MC is beloved  he isnt overwhelmingly perfect  completely blind  or constantly putting himself in stupid situations where he should know better  Its also not a tale of will they or wont they  which I appreciate more than anyone knows  and contains a very original storyline  as Calmes is wont to do  Its also intriguing enough that  should this become a series  Lynnie and Wade  anyone    I will happily continue on as long as a  the next book isnt a continuation of these MCs and b  it doesnt devolve into such ridiculousness as Sam and Jorys relationship that makes me want to lob off my head  This was exactly the kind of book Ive been needing from Calmes and Im thrilled to have found it  And really  can anyone say anything bad about Greg Boudreaux  Not me  for sure  The man is a rockstar behind the mic  Definitely worth a blind credit  I truly enjoy TL Swan s stories and this is my second favorite audiobook of all time following  Mr Masters   Both narrators do a phenomenal job and I know I ll be listening to this story over and over Spencer is a player and Charlotte is an innocent sheltered heiress  The two together create a steamy storm of emotions that bleed off the page and through the narration straight to my heart  I hope you love it as much as I do  I highly recommend it  JP This book made me squirm uncomfortably and put it down occasionally just so I could do a little soul searching  This story is so cleverly told through hindsight and foresight and answers that universal question if I could go back would I make the same decisions  It brilliantly points out that the obvious choice  the easy choice and the smart choice while easily discernable from the outside  on the inside  with circumstances and issues nagging at you   the choices are much more difficult  And while the characters and narrators are Australian  the circumstances are universal  I  think  this might be more appealing if you have a few years under your belt  but I sure as heck would have loved to have read it 10years ago Loved it  Please try a bit harder to match the narrator to the class genres of the Writer s story  I don t know Mr  Brick  I do know he should not be reading stories by Mr  Krueger  His interpretations are much better applied to sappy romance or religious novels  I managed 50 of chapter 1  It made me nauseous  I listen to a lot of really good books  I honestly can t remember if I ve ever given a review before  This book hits on so many truths I feel if I don t write this review I ll regret it forever  What Brian has accomplished here is a masterpiece  As an atheist I ve explored my relationship with the universe via psychedelic s many times  so to have a book that explains the history of our ancestors path of finding god through the use of these taboo tools is so refreshing  I feel that spirituality is something we all feel at one level or another  yet a large majority of our species aren t aware that you can connect with the cosmos via these organic tools provided  This book is hands down the best yet at revealing the vast history of mans use of drugs to expand the collective consciousness  and the influence these compounds had on early religions  It s also a grim reminder of how some groups are threatened by these ideas and will stop at nothing to conceal them Fight the war on consciousness and buy this book  This work is an eye opener Brian and PJ  Thank you  You both made it happen P S  Graham Hancock presents the forward to the book and knocks it straight out the FKING PARK  Have always loved this book and when I found it in unabridged form I was thrilled  The first copy I purchased was narrated by the author  and while I love her books  I could not stand the sound of her voice  I was never able to get through the audio version because of it Now this new narrator is great and gives the feel of Meg Murray and her family  She does a great job  Story  great  narrator great  definitely recommended  I got this book on recommendation from a trusted mentor as I was brand new to the concept of the enneagram  I highly recommend this as a fantastic place for people who are curious about it  This book helped me identify my type  2   Discovering my hidden motives and desires has been both fascinating and  in some ways  crushing for me  but definitely worth the pain to better understand myself and the dynamics of my relationships with others  What would have made Gone Girl better  I thought this book had great value and wished I d read it a year or two earlier  Great insights and points to be made  I loved the fact that this was written to be direct for people to flip to what they need  and in a natural order Audio  however  wasn t so conducive to that  I think this is a book I d prefer a book of  for a change  I just listened to the whole thing straight through and I know it ll be hard to refer to if I want to look back and review something later  vs  a book You will feel like you need to pull allnighters  Your social life will suffer  If you use audio books while at the gym  you ll reach your goal weight as you easily lose track of four hours on a treadmill  You will be tired and dependent on coffee  This was me and it was worth it Enter Sanderson s Cosmere at your own risk  I regret nothing  What made the experience of listening to The Glass Castle the most enjoyable  I was unsure about this book because of what I heard regarding the theology  I dont like regurgitating what I hear from others so I decided to check The Shack out on my own     so I could properly criticize it  After listening to it I was left stunned and had to seriously rethink some of my theology  This is truly a awesome book   This is such an amazing listening experience  If this was fiction you would say it was way too far fetched  Truth is so much stranger  Of my 300 audible books this is in the top 5  For those of you who have been lucky enough to read   Master of the Senate   this is the book end for that fab series on lyndon johnson  It was robert caros purpose to expose the workings of power on the local and national level  hence this award winning masterpiece of research and writing  taking almost 10 years to write  AND the lyndon johnson series  the last of which were still waiting for impatiently  I learned so much about power  politics and how the world really works by reading caros masterpieces  If you dont like long books Be forewarned it is long  really long  I wouldnt cut a single word out of it though  It was actually been cut and edited back to fit in a paperback form  A must read  as far as I m concerned I really wanted to enjoy this book as the premise was initially very interesting How to be Smarter  Faster  Better  With this genre of book  however  it s really important to cite interesting stories and examples  then provide actionable insights into how to apply the information we ve just been given  This didn t end up happening until the appendix  which was the most interesting part of this book  With the exception of one or two eyebrow raising moments  most of the book dragged on  I found myself rolling my eyes after listening to what seemed like the same paragraph rephrased over and over  I know the author was trying to go for a Malcolm Gladwell type of book but it just wasn t as well written nor was the content that interesting The performance of the narrator was very clear  but felt that he wasn t being absorbed by the content either  resulting in disengaged  robotic storytelling  Many have read this book  and have come away inspired to follow the path established by its author  P  Yogananda  Others have simply been left with a fascinating story about a man who came to America in 1920 with nothing  and by the time that he left his body  had met with the President of the United States and future governor of California and established a religious path which is still standing to this very day Regardless of the vantage point you may be coming from  this is a delightful read  and an excellent introduction to Eastern religious thought  the way it had been originally taught  before it was watered down by charlatans simply looking to cash in on the  latest fad  The audio version is an absolute delight  and Ben Kingsley s reading is inspired  This is not a man  going through the motions  to collect a paycheck  Every single word is thoughtfully and smoothly enunciated  making this a pleasure to listen to  Thus  I would highly recommend this to even those who have already read the print version Finally  let me recommend the following don t listen to this while jogging  driving in heavy traffic  or while otherwise distracted  Set some time aside and listen intently  Still my favorite audiobook  Not only is it a delight for children but for adults as well  What makes it incomparable is E B  White s narration  While I guess it is a decent account of the Mongol empire  and and excellent account of 18th and 19th century European prejudice  the book felt like a cheering section for the Mongol empire  All of their motivations were just for the betterment of mankind and they were forced into all conflicts through no fault of their own  It does accurately recognize contributions made by the empire as well as those innovations which are still felt in the modern day  But it would be as if saying the Roman empire only did good things and for the betterment of civilization  While the Roman empire did do lots of good things and some of their legacy is still being felt to this day  it wasn t all good  I feel the presentation of the Mongol empire as completely egalitarianand mostly altruistic is unbalanced  Lyrical prose is woven into this story of a compelling period in our history  The story line is believable  and is an adept portrayal of how human beings can treat and react to each other  I believe I would have enjoyed this book much more if I had consumed it with my eyes instead of my ears  I missed the opportunity to go back a few pages to check a line or reread a paragraph  The complexity of the story is at times like the quiet taste of a familiar herb in a vibrantly constructed meal  something you can t quite place  can t quite encompass on the first pass  I would recommend this book  with the reminder that other listeners may have the same problem maintaining grasp of the elusive thread  I ve listened to several hundred books  and would place this in the top 50  Ive been listening to Casey for years on Bitch Sesssh and have been anticipating the release of this book  She has not disappointed  Wow  Laughing out loud  So grateful Casey did her own audiobook  could listen to her for hours which I am currently doing  This may very well be my most favorite business book ever  Solid advice for everything from the best way to do a review to how to handle interruptions  Will listen several additional times  Absolutely thrilled that this is now on audible  This scholarly work connects the dots of increased partisanism  antiimmigrant prejudice and Trumps electoral victory  Citing many historical examples  the authors synthesize more than 100 years of U S  and World history to persuasively examine trends and tendencies in our domestic politics  Written in a nonpartisan way  the authors cite antidemocratic actions by Republicans and Democrats alike  Dont waste another evening on Fox News or MSNBC  listen to this book and gain some real insights into current events and the future of our democracy  DISCLAIMER I am a leftleaning Democrat and I strongly disagree with Speaker Boehner on most things political  I am also wellaware he voted for Trump s reelection  Nevertheless  I put aside my partisan opinions and rated this book strictly on the merits From the beginning  Speaker John Boehner doesn t mince words  He is frank and forthright on his thoughts of many of his fellow Republicans  the Democrats  Speaker Pelosi  every President since Nixon  the culture of Washington  and the current state of our politics  He also dives deep into his own personal history and talks about how working at his family bar prepared him for dealing with the cast of characters that roam Congress To his credit  he managed to keep the partisanship to a minimum  He spent more time talking about the institution of the House of Representatives and less time going into the details of legislation  Overall  Boehner spent more time talking up the merits of institutionalism and how it is most effective in achieving results  Even as a progressive  I felt he made a very strong case explaining how building alliances and forming consensus builds far greater longterm success than populist outrage While On The House wasn t always the most organized  Speaker Boehner more than makes up for it with his stories and humor  It also helps that he narrated his own book  There were several instances where I almost fell out of my chair from laughing  WARNING Don t eat popcorn while listening to this Overall  I give it 5 stars  I ll never see eyetoeye with the guy politically  but I respect him  Most political memoirs are boring and as canned as a teleprompter speech  This one was straight from the gut  I purchased the first book of this series to listen to on our road trip for Spring Break  After 12 hours of driving we had only less than an hour left and they didn t want to get out of the car   Very well written and read and my children enjoyed it so much we have purchased them all   We are now on the 3rd book and listen to it every time we are in the car  This has also had a pleasant side affect of no more sibling squabbling while driving   lolHighly recommend   Okay  so  I ALMOST didnt use my credit for the month on this book  Some of the negative reviews were scathing  and I try not to pick up books unless they come recommended by people or sources I trust This trilogy won THREE Hugo awards   Ive never met a Hugo winner I didnt Love     So I ignored the naysayers THANK GOD I havent enjoyed a book this much since the first time I read Dune The sequels will be the first time I spend money for books beyond the free credits Guys  this book is wonderful The characters are beautiful  tragic  and desperately human  The setting is refreshingly new  The plot is      you get the point I hope you decide to ignore the negative reviews and give it a chance  Savor it  Take it slow  and PAY ATTENTION  The author is masterful in her storytelling Thats the strongest review I can give  but I wish I could give more Steve The story is excellent but I cannot say the same for Jesse Bernsteins performances in this series  He is inconsistent in his voices  his inflection is awkward most of the time  and he has a very limited range of voices he can do  This is especially prevalent in his voicing of the side character campers who all sound like Clarisse in different wigs  Other than that  his pacing is good and his voice acting for characters like Percy and Grover is decent  I enjoyed the passion in which this book was written and recorded by Pastor Giglio I understood the message of my Lord through the Pastors words and explanations I feel that I have been given the tools to remove the enemy from my table life and continue on a path the Jesus made for me  I love how this story brings the scripture stories to life   thought provoking and engaging  Cant wait for more   Shari Mead I loved this novel like all of the others by Richards  This one in particular tickled me because I was sure of the plot from the very beginning only to be blindsided at several turns  The title is very appropriate  and while some of the dialog is a bit cringy at times  I feel it captures the subtle charm of what it is to be human  I can t wait to see what is next I am always on the look out for a Radclyffe book  especially if it is a doctors book  And this one was as great as her other books  Loved it  Loved the main characters I would have loved though another narrator     I never cared too much for 50 cent  I ve also never bought or listened to any of his albums  I found him to be in conflict with people far too often and I considered him to be petty and lowlevel functioning  Why get in the ring when you own the stadium  It didn t make sense to me  It s one thing to be in conflict earlier on in your career but at this point     For what and why  I just so happened to be reading the 50th Law when he dropped his new book I wasn t sure if the genius behind the 50th law was truly Robert Greene with Curtis as the billboard or if it was actually a partnership  When I got the notification for his new book  I purchased it immediately Never would I have ever thought all of his conflict were ALL purposeful and calculated  I was shocked to know he connected the dots enough to create such strategic moves  A lot of his principles are things I do   How I play my hand  if you will  The duality to him is interesting because it s something we all deal with on some level  Curtis  the business man  head coach of the chess team  mogul and business man wrote this book  It was refreshing and highly worth the read for anyone who is in need of strengthening their mindset and needing assistance in getting put on to the rules to handling business wither entrepreneurial or corporate  You can hear the vulnerability and pain speaking of certain situations in his life  his first born son and his son s mother My hope is to see him come full circle in stepping into the full power he has acquired in business within his broken personal relationships  It would be a true demonstration of actualizing acquired knowledge only time can tell  Anywho    there is a lot of truth and tools on this man s tool belt and it would be nice to see more of this side of Curtis  I look forward to his next projects    Lord knows I can t wait for Power Book II    WHEW  The one thing I loved most about this book  is it exemplifies a personal belief of mine which is  Nothing is ever wasted   Everything you go through   every trial  error  triumph or defeat all serve a purpose for you to learn from  Those gems you gain from the experiences will be useful to you somewhere down the line  Curtis is living proof  He applied his street smarts to the boardroom and he s winning  Kudos to more win  greater success and for filling meaningful relationships  Much respect  While I m pushing past 1 000 audiobooks  more than 700 thru Audible alone  this has to be in the Top Ten of my all time favorites  I wanted to stay with it through a single reading  it was so good  It s 4AM as I write this  seriously  There s just one aspect of the story line that requires a little suspension of belief  but just go with it and you will be richly rewarded  And the ending  well  you ll never see it coming  It was that  good  Great story  great characters  and hard to put down  The trifecta of storytelling    I highly recommend this trilogy  but  only if you like dragons  magic  and a good fight for the triumph of good over evil  Seems like every other book I listen to is so highly derivative that my opinion hinges almost solely on whether it is a worthwhile step forward or a redundant rehash  Red Rising  after a promising start  slowly but inexorably proved itself to be a cynical exercise in cashing in on the popularity of The Hunger Games RR hero is from the mines  HG heroine is from the mines  RR 12 tribes  HG 12 districts  RR kids go through a  draft  before being sent to a carefully designed course to compete in games against each other  with help from proctors  while being watched from afar by the privileged class  HG ditto  ditto  ditto  except that they called them mentors instead of proctors and they call it a reaping instead of a draft  RR young girl sings a song of rebellion before dying  HG young girl sings a song before dying that becomes the theme of rebellion  RR has the Reaper  HG has the reaping This is not inadvertent similarity  This is either willful ignorance  especially on the part of the editor  who should have known better  or outright plagiarism  If you re going to do this  you have to add something  Especially in characterization  especially to the main character In that respect  Red Rising is retrograde  Katniss  like Harry Potter and Tris from Divergent  is never that sure of herself  is the last to recognize her power  is always the reluctant hero  Darrow Reaper  from the very first scene  is the best ever  and he knows it  And yet as brilliant as he will tell you he is  he falls for four  five traps in a row  getting many of his friends killed in the process  And when faced with a choice between doing the right thing or getting revenge  the always selfrighteous Darrow inevitable chooses bloody revenge Jeez  if you re going to rip off a beloved story  don t reverse all of its best qualities  To which you can add the central conceit of Red Rising social  political and economic inequality is embodied in a facile colorcoding system  Hunger Games presents the same issues in a far more nuanced way  even down to the subtleties of fashion and mannerism  without resorting to obvious gimmickry Other bones to pick the level of violence is off the charts for a supposedly YA entry  and the internal logic of this world fails early and often  especially the technology  I for one will not be moving on to the ensuing episodes in this trilogy  Forget high school science  Just have your kids enjoy this book  Bryson gives a very understandable and thorough overview of astronomy  physics  chemistry  biology  geology  etc   in an extremely engaging way  It is like hearing your favorite college professor sit down on a table in front of a group of students and weaving a fascinating story  The human interest aspects of the books were a plus to the scientific explanations  Although this is a tremendously enjoyable read for inquisitive adults  share it with your children and they might actually take up an enduring interest in science  This book is certainly far better than all of my high school science courses combined  and probably college too   Highly recommended  Book 3 in this series left in a large cliffhanger  a plan and coarse of action to travel in order to save one of the main character s sister  I took a break on the series for a bit to catch up on some other series  but when I came back  I was instantly hooked once again  I love learning more about each character and their distinct personalities  The story was tense and full of action  with each character on the journey offering their own qualities to help further their quest  Great story  great tension  and great ending  I m looking forward to the rest in the series  A fun and enjoyable book  I can t wait for the movie  would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a lighthearted book Another great book by Amy Daws  I have to say this might be my new favorite  I loved Santino  Tilly s story so much  They have history which is a huge plus for me  they both have baggage and they have awesome chemistry  I also really enjoyed the Harris Brothers connection  it s like visiting old friends  This one will become a regular relisten for me I am sure The narration was awesome  I always love Will Watt and Paula Costello s Scottish accent was amazing in my opinion  Five books in now and Im still absolutely loving all the alpha members of the disbanded Tin Gypsy MC and these brothers have a tight bond of friendship with each other   theyre loving  supportive  possessive  loyal alphas to the women they love   and become fierce protectors for their families  But  in Leos case  its guilt over past sins in his biker dark lifestyle that initially stops him from claiming the redheaded Firecracker Cass who hed had a very memorable one night stand with  Fortunately for Leo  Cassandra is a very forgiving woman because she is willing to give him plenty of chances to get it right   to get his emotions under control   and to stepup and be a supportive Father in their unplanned babys life The road to happiness isnt going to be easy for either of them and disappointment will be felt by Cass more than just once   but  if and when Leo finally lets his heart overrule his head  Cass will be there with open arms and with forgiveness and love for a man who doesnt think he deserves any or it  And  through impressive character growth and a very loving  generous  supportive partner  Leo becomes the wonderful caring man I always knew he could be  But the lifethreatening chilling accidents that keep happening to him are becoming deadly and very very suspicious   who is behind it    why are they happening    and just what are they capable of to get revenge Worth a credit  Oh boy yes  and I get so excited when theres even a whiff of a new release from awesome author Devney Perry  especially her Tin Gypsy series which has me searching the Preorder List with finger poised ready to buy as soon as the book gets listed  And  with this book number 5  I wasnt disappointed because theres angst and relationship anxiety   drama and action   suspense  tension and danger   and lust  love and loyalty  Plus theres a secondary cast of preloved characters from past books  a strong worthy heroine and a droolworthy alpha hero   and sizzles  sex and plenty of delicious sighworthy touching sentiments too  Lucy and Jason     love you Jason  fit the dual POV storyline and its characters perfectly and their five star narration brought the characters  the feels  the heat and the heart to life   well done guys  I have to take a line from Gigi to describe this book  It made me feel all fizzy inside  I fell in love with West and Gigi from the moment they lock eyes at The Library to the whirlwind night they spend together and everything in between  So much good flirty banter  I also loved that neither of them gives up no matter what happens Some of my favorite bits of this book  aside from sexy times  are when they geek out with their retro games  They are so playful and fun  I just adored that so much  Their first kiss  so delicious  The scene where Gigi gets so pissed at West that she mocks him  That was perfectly performed by Lili Valente  It made me laugh  And last  theres a chapter where West is so damn romantic that it made me cry Lili Valente and Shane East made this an absolute pleasure to listen to and I plan on doing it again and again  I love Bren Browns work  having only  somehow  discovered her work in the last year  I tend to believe its the when the student is ready the teacher appears thing  Anyway  while on vacation and focusing on my play I listened cover to cover today  especially enjoying that Bren reads her own work  This is just so freaking GOOD and powerful   I will listen again and again  and yes  go to the hub to pull down all the things also released today to accompany  What a teacher and what a great thing to be a part of  Brens community I enjoyed this book very much  While Lewis hasn t quite converted me to Christianity  he has given me a much deeper and more nuanced understanding of the religion s basic teachings and ideas than I could have ever scrounged up on my own  Overall an enjoyable listen  Julian RhindTutt is delightfully British  Another hit by Mr  Gladwell  He take something as dry as sociology and presents the theories in vignettes that are so interesting  yet are factual demonstrating the points he is walking the reader through  I wish more teachers were as stimulating as him  One other point  this book is read by the author which I really appriciate  This gives you more the intent and tone of the original author  It has almost no relation to the movie but makes some very interesting points in its own right  In some ways I like it even better than the movie  There is a whole subplot in the book about people needing to care for the remaining animals on the planet only alluded to in the movie with the one line asking if the owl is real  In the book people that cannot afford real animals to take of get electric ones to keep face with the neighbors  The commentary on this and how culty people can be might turn some off but I thought it made the story more relevant to the real world  Reese is a beast  Don t mess with the Roach Amazing work  This is an another great book by Rhett C  Bruno and Mr  Bray IS The Roach  Bray was made for this character  Full of action and unexpected twists  this novel really brings it I have completely gobbled this book up twice already  I will listen again until we convince the author to write another story about our Roach EditAs I read listen to this again it brings to mind Gotham  but dirtier and more crimeridden It reminds me of Watchmen  but the characters are exponentially better developed  I never thought I d use heartfelt and intense action to describe the same book but here we are  I really felt like this was as much a mystery and thriller as it is vigilante hero antihero  Honestly  I loved everything about this book  Ali Wong s narration is perfect  She tells it like it is  she s honest  and does not hold anything back  I m not a mother  but as a daughter I can definitely respect this type of honesty  I think what topped it off for me was the afterword done by her husband  Justin Hakuta  To hear a man speak they way he did about Ali and his daughters just melted my heart and reafirms my belief that there are good men out there  Thank you for this book   So engaging  So brilliant  So imaginative  Not a rehash  All original  Surprises at every turn  Amazing ride  Highly recommended  I have lost hours of sleep two nights in a row because of this book  I couldn t stop pressing the gold button for 28 minutes more Sadhguru took time out of his insanely busy schedule to read this book to us  Sadhguru  do you feel guilty for robbing us of this much sleep Surprisingly  this book has been a  hide under the covers with a flashlight and hope the parents don t catch you  type of read  I really found it that engrossing And having been through it a couple of times  I feel more optimistic about being able to  handle my karma   i e  life  About enjoying life in general  And I feel a renewed willingness to do my part to handle the problems of others  For  as one of Sadhguru s aphorisms for beginning yogis says  my paraphrase  All rules are my rules  I understand that in a more profound way after reading this book Sadhguru doesn t hold back in this book  Although he has always been forthcoming when teaching  he has also sometimes expressed a fear of making us  hallucinatory  if he went ahead and shared things beyond our personal experience  Yet in this book  he seems to go farther  And I for one am grateful I will probably keep reading this book over and over  Until now  Jane Austen s novels are the only books I ve felt that way about  I never tire of reading them  I think this book from Sadhguru will be the same  I do hope I can get some sleep soon  though  When I announced that I was listening to a story with the title   Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter   my friends looked at me like I d lost my mind  Like them  I was skeptical at first but the sheer laugh factor of the title was enough to spark my curiosity Having finished the book I can happily say that this was one of the most interesting stories I ve listened to in a long time  The mixture of fact and fiction is flawless  so much so that I found myself taking the story to heart in places  A worthy spin on an already extraordinary life  I highly recommend it  I think Simon is great  The way he approaches this issue  as well as  his work on millineals  SP  is top notch  I have heard time speak  and watch many of his TED talks on this subject  Naturally  alot of overlap  I think your better off watching the TED talks and getting than listening to the audio book The story was phenomenal by itself but the narrator was so exceptional I got completely sucked in  He made it so enjoyable  The performances are outstanding  It s a great value at 1 credit To make it more useful

15Chapter 74 2 John 1Chapter 75 3 John 1Chapter 76 Jude 1Chapter 7798 Revelation 122 It s very good and very informative  a minor work by an esteemed historian  a collection of essays  really  The basic question that frames the book is  how she  both as a Black woman and as a historian  claim that she loves Texas given its racist history  Her answer takes her in a couple of directions exploring the real history of Texas and how that history is  and has been  taught  her discussion of the Alamo is itself worth the price of admission  illuminating the history of African Americans in Texas from before it was a republic  through its admission into the United States  up to today sharing her own experiences were growing up Black in Texas and providing insight into the roles history and narrative play in how Texans see their state I enjoyed listening to it  learned a lot  and felt that I had spent in the company of a very smart  knowledgeable  candid  and gracious individual  It was definitely time well spent The narrator does a very solid job  There were a few moments of what I took to be small editing glitches  unnaturally long pauses  but nothing that interferes with enjoying the work  I have no reservations at all about recommending the book  Our nation is poorer for not having Trey Gowdy in Congress anymore  But DOESN T HURT TO ASK is not about politics and it is not political  It is about the power of using properly framed questions to communicate  connect and persuade  It is an outstanding book by a marvelous person  Gowdy is not a professional narrator but he narrates his book with the authority that only he can provide  Doesn t hurt to ask is recommended for everyone  I also recommend UNIFIED by Tim Scott and Trey Gowdy  At times  this audiobook reminded me of John Irving s A Prayer for Owen Meany  However  where Owen Meany is vast and expansive  Sam Hell is somewhat predictable  That being said  The Extraordinary Life of Sam Hell is still pretty good  The novel deals in familiar themes prejudice  racism  love  and religion  Every twist or turn in the book can be seen from a mile away  but the story is still engaging  Dugoni does a great job of reading his own work  He s a talented narrator  Although this novel is not of the caliber of Irving s A Prayer of Owen Meany  it did remind me of it  and that in itself is a compliment  This isn t the greatest book ever written  but it is good  and it kept my attention for the entire 11 hours  It goes on a little longer than necessary and loses a little steam  but overall I enjoyed it Overall rating 4 22 stars This book moved me in the way the movie Saving Pvt  Ryan did  especially that movies initial DDay scene   There are countless war movies and books  but these are the only two I am familiar with that were capable of bringing home the horror of war  My father fought in WWII and never told war stories or even talked about combat other than in vague ways  In his view war was a senseless meat grinder  I never felt I knew what he was getting at until after I d seen Saving Pvt  Ryan and read All Quiet on the Western Front All Quiet is written by a WWI combat veteran and tells tells the story of Paul Baumer who  along with his classmates is encouraged to join the war with a great deal of patriotic talk by those who  by virtue of their age or position  need never fight themselves  Paul soon discovers that  as U S  Gen  Sherman said I am tired and sick of war  Its glory is all moonshine  It is only those who have neither fired a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded who cry aloud for blood  for vengeance  for desolation  War is hell  and There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory  but  boys  it is all hell  I finished this book thinking  for mankind to evolve  wars should simply be banned  or  as suggested by Paul and his comrades  turned into lifeanddeath tournaments between the world leaders and generals who declare them  The narrator is perfect and really does the material justice  And the writing itself is beautiful  Unreservedly recommended  A the book was good but I had come to enjoy the 2nd epilogue and there wasn t one This book has a bit of everything  There are people I found myself pulling for  people I wanted to see get what was coming to them and some people that alternated between those two possibilities It had intrigue and backstabbing and some gold old fashioned government turf wars to boot I loved everything about this book and did not want to stop until I had finished the whole thing  This has to this point been my favorite nonfiction audiobook release of 2017  This is my favorite fiction book ever  and the only book that comes in a close second is Ender s Game  I loved  Starship Troopers  the first time that I read it at 13 years old  and I really loved listening to the audio recording 14 years later at 27  I drove around and wasted exhorbitant amounts of gas just so I could continue listening to it  It was nice  I reccommend this book to any person 13 years of age or above  I often listen read kids  books with my 10yearold daughter and usually like them  The One and Only Ivan was no exception  It s one of this year s Sunshine State Books for 3rd5th graders  They  Florida education officials  select 15 books each year and we ve yet to come across one that hasn t been excellent  This book teaches about kindness and the importance of  peer  interaction  The chapters in the book were numerous and short  The story snippets were organized and easy to follow  Everything blended together well  Listen  and read along  with your kid  You will both enjoy the experience  A clip from the NYTimes book review by Eleanor Henderson  But while it makes for a heady journey through the bands ascent  the script format inherently limits our access to the characters innermost selves  The camera is locked on a tripod  the interviewees confessing their greatest fears and loves in the same shouldersup shot for much of the novel  After a while  we long to get closer  to hear what the characters arent confessing on the record  or to zoom out  to take in more of the decade than its miniature backstage dramas  When only the characters narrate the story  their reminiscences can fall flat  The reviewer is clearly referring to the print version here  I think this critique doesn t apply to the audio version with multiple narrators performing the  script   The voices are distinctive and nuanced  and they do provide the listener access to  the characters  innermost selves   Like all good dramatic storytelling  the characters evoke emotion through HOW they express themselves as much as through WHAT they express  That s not available when all you have is words on the page and no authorial intermediary commenting on the characters  inner states and outward behaviors  Others have said it here and on other sites  this book is uniquely suited to audio and takes the audiobook experience to a new level of listener engagement  For me  the story itself is nothing special and does not transcend the familiar tropes about rock stars bands in the 70s  But the format  voice casting  and performances make it a truly compelling work of audio fiction  A captivating listen as Anthony Bourdain takes you through a wild ride of his restaurant grind  from the bottom to the top  This book was an incredible opportunity to see a life that is more foreign to me than almost anything I can imagine  I regret that it s the news of his recent suicide that turned me on to his book  Honor this man by giving his book a listen  you won t regret it  This novel is fast paced and complex  The three main characters endure the War in Italy  We feel deeply for the characters and all the people in the story  I could not wait to hear what was going to happen next  The novel gave me so much hope for our shared humanity  Everyone makes a difference and Love Is Eternal  Enjoy  Being a fan of the world of MiddleEarth since I was about ten or so  I was delighted when in Middle School I discovered the unabridged audiobook recordings produced by Recorded Books  As with most of what RB does  they picked the perfect narrator  British stage actor Rob Inglis does an excellent job of bringing the many characters to life  in this case Bilbo and Thorin and Company  not to mention the many characters they meet o their quest to recover the Dwarves  treasure  And unlike most narrators  Mr  Inglis actually sings the many songs sprinkled throughout the story and  while he doesn t always choose what I would consider the right tune for all the given songs  he does have a good tenor  His regular narration style is also extremely pleasant on the ears  and his pronunciation of the names of characters and places is also excellent  Needless to say I was extremely disappointed when Audible removed these recordings from their site some years back and extremely delighted a few days ago when I discovered they d made them available once again  I used this month s two credits to buy The Hobbit and Fellowship of the Ring and plan to use next month s two to buy the remainder of the story  If you re a fan of the Lord of the Rings and were disappointed or at least not completely satisfied by the other adaptations out there  you may just be in for a pleasant surprise if you give these unabridged productions a listen  It s much more convenient having them available in digital format since you won t have to worry about tapes or discs wearing out  which they inevitably do eventually  I just need to get myself a bigger IPod  What made the experience of listening to Invisible Man the most enjoyable  What a joy this is  made more so by Alex Kingstons performance  The plot is complex to no end  juggling a main story  as well as a storywithinastory  skipping wildly through time  doubling back on itself  encountering new and familiar faces along the way  and eventually blurring which is the main story and which is the storywithinastory  Its a wonder that with so many plot threads  taking us farther and farther from any sign of a conclusion  it is able to neatly and satisfyingly tie it all up in the end I will say that at a few points some of the minor characters are hard to keep track of  But otherwise this is a heck of a tale  Its as if someone said No one writes a more timeywimey tale than Stephen Moffat  and then Alex Kingston replied  Hold my beer  And her reading isnt just your standard narration  This is a performance  Having served in Iraq and dealing with ISIS first hand myself in 2009 and 2010  she missed key history on their rise of destruction in Iraq  in October 2010 they took over the Iraqi stock exchange and an orthodox Christian Church which they held hostage for many hours October 30th of that year  I was part of the negotiations and attempted rescue but they slaughtered many that year in their furious rise to power as we handed over prisons to the Iraqi government  Overall good so far but she is not correct on when they rose to power  The Good Shepherd is about eight hours of listening in unabridged format  written by C S  Forester way back in 1955  ten years after the end of WWII  The story takes place in 1942  The Good Shepherd is fiction  although the circumstances are based on fact  The United States did escort thousands of men and supplies in convoys of ships to Europe  The convoys were protected by destroyers leading them across the North Atlantic through the Wolf Packs of German Uboats This is the story of one such journey and the captain of the lead destroyer  his strengths  weaknesses  faith  experience  The Good Shepherd takes place primarily on the bridge of the destroyer from the viewpoint of the captain  Decisions  constant fear  and vigilance  ship movements  stealth  strategy  are all riveting FYI  The Good Shepherd is the basis for the Tom Hanks movie  Greyhound  Hanks portrays Captain Krause  the main character  and the main motivation for reading  The book to movie script is very well done  It is rarely a tossup as to which is better  book or movie  it is always the book  But  in this case  both are superb Nicely narrated by Edoardo Ballerini  no issues  and released by Podium Audio in May of 2020 Recommended  I m a simple guy  I see Chaney  I buy This one delivered exactly what I wanted  A great story  fun characters  and a superb narration  My only question is when is book 2 coming out  I see it s out on ebook already  so I hope that means the audio is around the corner I love how Chaney puts these out so efficiently  It s incredible  Seriously  after reading the reviews of this last book I almost decided not to read it  It was just as good as the previous three However  I do believe I understand now why everyone seem to slam it with a disappointing review Here is whyI am sure you all have read many books in the past  and when you finally finish the series you start to imagine what would happen afterwards  Well in this last book it has that information  The book actually ended  In my opinion  about 3 quarters  or more  of the way through the book  In this audio version    at what I would have called the end of the book there is an addition 4 5 hours left  all of it about what happens afterwards Simply put about one  or two  chapters after the war with Galbatorix is over that is what I would call  The End   The rest of it should have been called something else  The intensity of everything that had just happened can not be matched with the piddly administrative stuff that happens afterwards  It was interesting  and I enjoyed reading it  However if the book would have ended where I think it should have  they my last impressions of the book would have been  OMG  Wowness  Group Hug    But if you are like so many others who have left those comments that are less then amazing  it is because they are judging their whole experience on the way the feel at the end of the book  Which like I said tapers off to Not so Amazing  In fact it went from  Group Hug  to just  ug      But I didn t let that ruin it for me  Because like I said the bug ended for me with  OMG  Wowness  Group Hug   the rest was just the administrative stuff that happened afterwards Advice read until you find what you feel was the end  then close the book and say  OMG  Wowness   Gloat on it a bit then when you ready to read about the administrative stuff afterwards open it up again and finish it I hope this helps  Group Hug  I absolutely love the DA series and have been following it since I stumbled onto it on Kindle and it has never let me down  Book 4 is filled with loot  questing  and secrets revealed  I enjoyed every moment of it and can t wait for book 5  Travis Baldree did another excellent job narrating and I hope he continues to do the next  Hat s off  folks    I don t know where he received all of his insights  but I happen to own ALL of the other Law of Attraction books  beginning with Napoleon Hill  whom I have become so familiar with that I seriously consider him a friend  I have witnessed many of the seemingly impossible things this author is a witness to  and already know that everything he says here is true  and it really is as simple as he makes it appear to be  But  this man is clearly a genius full of understanding of the way this works  and his title is no exaggeration  He actually goes into it in SO MUCH detail that  in case you might have missed it  you won t  This guy is a wonderful teacher AND  to be redundant  he really does know how it works  Moreover  he is able to articulate it so that  as he says  this really will be the last book on the law of attraction you will ever need  Better still  it is likely to be the first book on the topic that will actually free you to experience the many miraculous things  like I said  that I know these laws will make happen for you  What a miracle that this book came out when it did  take advantage  it will change your life  A weak follow up to the tenant  Started off good but just lacked the overall good ending that can often accompany these thriller detective novels  The twist or aha moment of why crimes were commented was only mentioned in passing at the very end and last few chapters felt forced  That being said I love the detective team being established here and will absolutely continue to the next book  I honestly feel sad for anybody who passed up on this audio book  based on the previous negative review  This guy accomplished more in his life than most people ever will  He s qualified to talk about ego  This recording changed my life  Read  What did you love best about Parable of the Sower  Although another reviewer rated 2 stars because of the narration  I think Imogen Church is one of the best female narrators out there  so I guess it really does boil down to personal preference I ve listened to three or four other Ruth Ware titles and feel that Church does a phenomenal job  She is a perfect match for the author s style of writing  If you ve ever read or listened to Ware before  you ll know that her stories are often filled with inner dialogue  which  in my eyes  happens to be one of Churches biggest strengths  Her pacing is spot on and she definitely has a talent for emphasizing in all the right places  The flow is so natural it s as if you re listening to someone else s conversations firsthand It s always harder to satisfy readers in audio format  anyway  because success no longer relies solely on the author s prose  but on the combination of written word and performance I don t want to give anything away  and although in my opinion it does seem as if the plot follows the same basic formula as her previous works  Ware is a talented writer who always provides enough intrigue to keep me coming back  Especially if she continues to pair with Imogen Church  I pushed myself to listen into chapter 2 and then I had to turn it off  Its Incredibly monotonous and repetitive  Perhaps reading the book is better but the narrator actually repeats the same story over and over again  I thought I had somehow rewound The Audible because if I heard him mention the metaphor about driving in a a car at 100 miles an hour and hitting a tree 20 more times I would have screamed If youre interested in how your thoughts are vibrations and how to manifest your desires check out Neville Goddard  Although there are a lot of references to the Bible  his explanation of how imagination creates reality is a lot more easily digestible  The first hour or so is the book was fine but as it progressed there were more and more sound errors and different sections repeated  The essays are excellent  though  I would skip the audiobook and purchase a printed copy  I have to admit I always wondered what the big deal was about this series although I saw some of the movies years ago and enjoyed them  I never read the books  When they became available on Kindle Audible however I ordered the first book for my 8 y o  daughter thinking shed like to listen to it  Then I thought Id try it out and see if I liked it myself I was a little hesitant having already seen the movie and worried that listening to the book might be repetitive  But  I learned quickly that I was SO WRONG  There is SO much more detail  storyline  insight and humor  amongst many other things  woven into the pages that of course you dont see on a DVD  I ended up listening to all 7 of the audiobooks in just under 2 months  and I finished Deathly Hallows about 4 days ago and I feel SO EMPTY  Lol  There is nothing else that will measure up compare to this series or its writer  I am going to start on JK Rowlings adult books next I think  but I have half a mind to relisten to my favorite Harry Potter books first  even this soon after finishing them  which Ive NEVER done  I love the characters  the effortless way the story builds throughout all 7 books and I love the fact that something that might have happened in book 2 or 3 might be referenced in later books  I also loved the real way that certain things that werent obvious in the beginning of the series  i e  whom Harry ends up with  develop in a way that feels completely natural and of course like that was meant to happen all along  Nothing in any of the HP books feels forced or conveniently created to serve a plotline that otherwise might be struggling  Despite its theme of witchcraft and wizardry Harry Potter seems very human and even relatable at times  thanks to the genius woman who created him  especially when it comes to his relationship with his closest friends  I think thats why its so hard to leave them behind Oh and yes  I agree with many other reviewers that Jim Dale was the one and only narrator who could ve brought this story to life in the amazing way that he did  So many characters  so many distinct voices  and he nailed them all in a way that I found myself comparing HIS version to the movie versions and  in many cases  finding I preferred Jim s I will miss Harry  Hermione  Ron  Sirius  Dumbledore  Hagrid  Snape  all the characters who made these books what they were  but I might have to revisit them soon because Im not sure Ill be able to handle this impending postHP depression hahaha  Wish me luck    This is the best book Ive ever heard or read in my life  EVER  Ive read so many self help books and each one helped me along the path  This one stands out at a time when its so needed  So refreshingly honest and funny  So delighted that the author herself narrated it  I truly believe   am I absolutely sure of this  No  that if a majority of humans read this book and actually applied it to their lives  we would find ourselves in an entirely wonderful  loving  empowering world  Truly life changing  Help yourself get out of the inferno of your thoughts  I read American Gods when it first came out and was amazed by what Neil Gaiman had done  I ve been a Gaiman fan since his work on Sandman and understood that the core of his stories is almost always myth and storytelling  American Gods has these in spades This new recording  featuring a full cast  is actually very good  Some say that there is no life in the characters  but there is  It s set against the bleak backdrop of a war between gods old and new  It s set against the seeming noninvolvement of the main character  Shaodow  who often seems to be along for the ride but ultimately acts as the one character the listener can relate to in a world filled with fantastical creatures called gods The first several times the cast interacts with the narrator can be jarring  but once the listener is used to the voices and the rhythm that builds over the first chapter or so  it becomes natural and the listener can get in to the story proper American Gods is dense  This edition has some 12 000 more words than previous editions  It is not a book to be taken lightly  It requires thought and it requires patience  Those willing to give it those things will find a solid  entertaining and thought provoking listen  Ideal blend of theory  research with practical perspectives  Some groups will feel he steps on their toes  better also order steel toed boots  This audiobook is really great  this book is really well Trading Bible   easy to understand  and it is a very useful practical guide for Beginners  i love this audiobook   Recommended Hey  Audible  You had a perfect version of this already recorded by R  C  Bray  I like Wheaton  but frankly his reading pales in comparison to Bray  And now we can t even buy that version   Seriously  folks  Find a CD of Bray s reading  It is awesome  I was very much spiraling in selfpitty and was quite gloomy when this book fell in my lap  I didn t know what I was looking for when I opened my Audible app  just anything that could shake me free from the apathy  I saw Russell Brand on the cover and figured I d give it a go  I ve always loved his work  so why not  It was exactly what I needed  It was like he was speaking right to me  Like he and I were on the phone having a good chat  It was familiar  engaging  upbeat and witty  His charm is in how he doesn t take himself too seriously  but isn t wasting my time trying to sell me anything  except his book  He genuinely just wants me to benefit from what he s discovered in his search for meaning  He is generous with sharing not only his his wisdom but also his humanity And I found this all on the very morning it was released  By accident  I thought it was strange that there weren t any reviews yet  It didn t occur to me that it was literally hot off the press Well Russell  you ve done it again My therapist suggested this read when I was having trouble finding compassion for selfish family and friends  This book changed my mindset in many ways especially with issues I believed I was doing great with  I bring up chapters from this audiobook to discuss in therapy and it has helped build on solutions and personal goals  Highly recommend   Really loved this book it s truly a modern classic  The narration is really excellent with amazing voices that add so much to the book  Only quibble is the women s voices are a bit strange at times  but totally a non issue in the end  I actually got a copy of this audiobook awhile ago from a friend which is the one I listened to  but wanted to support the author so I got it here too  plus I bought the actual book  Really good narrator  I am a big fan of the series and have read all the novels and novelas  This entry was enjoyable but not my favorite nor my least favorite  The authors continue to excel in their ability to create exceptional narrative  and Jefferson Mays continues his series of terrific performances  and are very good to great with plot  I feel the setting scope and size is getting away from the authors though  Earlier novels  character viewpoints felt right and aligned with the reader in the face of the large but covert conspiracy taking place  But now events seem so much larger than the characters  or at least some of the newer pov characters  and their perspectives seem    Inadequate  For example  Drummer reminds me more of a student body president and not arguably the premier head of state in all humanity  Which leads me to my biggest criticism Characterization  Many of the characters did not feel legitimate  For example  see Drummer above  and Singh was totally unbelievable as a senior officer in a Spartanesque military that feeds soldiers that fall asleep on duty to the protomolecule  The majority of the first act was introducing or reintroducing pov characters  The first few chapters felt like a repeated formula Here is character X  He or she is either a psychopath or a flawed hero who is wrestling with insecurity but finds comfort with his or her love of Y and here are some of those relationship s tender idiosyncrasies  Rinse and repeat with the next character  It really made the first act a hard read  but once the story got going  it was much more enjoyable  Also  while I liked that the setting moved forward by three decades to advance the story  it seemed like the characters took a time machine to get there  Except for a failed marriage or so  the main characters seem identical to who they were in the final chapters of the previous novel  It feels jarringly artificial Critical points aside  the Expanse is still a great series and I very much recommend the series to anyone who enjoys scifi or political conspiracy genres  If you read the first two and enjoyed them  read this one If you have not read the first two  don t read this yet  Read them  Another great book by Amy Daws  I love how funny her books are with a perfect amount of steam and sweet romance  This is a fake relationship romance which isn t normally my favorite trope but she did it better than anyone before her imho  Not only were Nora and Dean sweet and sexy  their banter was funny  silly and some times so ridiculous I don t think any one could not laugh  The connection and chemistry was on point and I couldn t wait to see them get a HEA  The second best thing about this book is the friendships and the banter with all of the girls  They made you want to be in their circle of friends  Without spoilers  I just have to say the Gilmore Girls banter was awesome  Every time Amy Daws brings up the Gilmore Girls in her books it makes me love her more Team Logan      Sorry Amy The narration was perfect but I would expect nothing less from Teddy  Erin because they are both my favorite  Together they really do comedy and sexy well  Fun fact Andrew Peterson would say makes this first edition of his reading of the book is quite special because of a  misread   when he is reading about Podo and the bagged thwaps  he refers to the grandchildren as his three children  and his daughter as his grandchild  Anyway   Our family has owned the printed book for a few years now  but it grew to become extra special to our family during the Covid19 shutdown of the world  and Andrew Peterson did nightly readings of the book  which we watched through Facebook Live and You Tube Live  The story reminds me of C  S  Lewis Narnia books  which if you know those stories  you know how your spirit and heart feel as you are drawn into the lives and settings the author has created  So very  very wonderful  To hear the actual author read a book is a treat  especially so for the Wingfeather series  because there are many interesting characters who have different accents and mannerisms that are much fun  or in some cases  quite creepy to hear  My husband and I  along with our children all highly recommend all the books in this series   Also highly recommended are the authors Autobiography Adorning the Dark  plus all his music  especially Is He Worthy  and All Things Together   The material is solid  spot on and I agree with everything  I also purchased a Kindle version as well as the audiobook to support the author  Five stars for the content and I highly recommend it  My gripe is with the recording itself  Richard is a self proposed successful entrepreneur and yet he cant get a professional recording done  The entire recording was done with a noise gate to compensate for an unprofessional recording space  probably in his bedroom  on either a DBX 286 or plugins and it is very annoying  This recording was done in an untreated room  in an unprofessional environment  When he talks you can hear the background noise  when he stops its dead silent  This contrast throughout the entire recording gets annoying quickly  Its unnatural and not smooth  For a self proclaimed successful person I would expect him to do much better  Either hire a professional narrator  get some acoustic treatment done in your recording space  or spend some money and rent a proper recording studio  I could understand if this was a 15 or 20 minute podcast but this is your book  people spend money on this product  Polish it  They deserve better  You have the means  this book has great ratings and you have a good following  The readers deserve it  It just lacks of integrity  Not ideal  With that said  I still recommend the book  As mentioned  it has great information which every man should be aware about and I hope the author eventually puts out more content but please dont skimp out in your product next time  Spend the money and get a professional recording done  Mystic Bayou is growing into such a tight knit town and I love it  the story is a great addition to the mystic family  I was so pleasantly surprised to see a new release today  If you ve enjoyed the other books in the series this is a great addition  if you haven t read any books in the series start with book 1 and be prepared to laugh and enjoy  This is not a good buy for an audiobook  There are lots of lists and questionnaires  I find it hard to follow along as he reads off 40 questions for you and your spouse to ask each other and discuss  I recommend buying the book or kindle version  Otherwise  lots of good information  Beware stereotypes like women are emotional and men are stonewallers are rampant but I imagine he s seen this first hand in his studies  Good news is he tries to release some of them by encouraging men to take advice from their wives and wives to    well i haven t gotten that far yet Happy reading  Very useful book  Even if you don t implement the full improvement strategy of apologizing and advertising it and following up  the various issues discussed are obviously true once you think about them  As the author says throughout  many of the solutions are simple  though not necessarily easy to implement  I would recommend this to anyone who works in an office environment  not just executives  In fact  the earlier in your career you recognize the issues the author discusses  the more effective you will be  You and me  as English speakers  do not really know why we re saying what we re saying  because English really is  as John McWhorter tells us  a magnificently bastardized language  So he s going to explain why you  say  something but he  says  it  why he doesn t believe what  they  say about language and culture  for example  why its says nothing about us if we identify our silverware as masculine  feminine  or gender neutral   and why you should not be  frightened  by the idea of German orphans having originated in ancient Phoenicia OK  that all sounds rather obtuse  That s because I m trying to cram into those two runon sentences a number of concepts McWhorter covers in his book  why it s OK to say  you and me  instead of  you and I   why we use the word  do  so much when it doesn t actually mean anything in that context  why we say  we re saying  so often instead of  we say   and how we would sound like Yoda if we spoke English the way most other Germanic languages are spoken  And he explains why we say  they  so much when we mean  he  or  she   and why only  he  or  she  have an  s  at the end of their verbs   why we say  going to  to indicate the future  and that the first written instance of this usage in Shakespeare literally meant the act of  going to  do something   why our nouns don t have genders as in Spanish or German  and how some words with ambiguous etymologies  like  frighten   may have come into our language from as long ago and far away as ancient Phoenicia And McWhorter does it all without getting too academic  despite being a professor of linguistics  and in an entertaining tone  which he himself narrates  although I was put off on two or three occasions when there was a little laugh in his narration when he was contradicting other linguists or linguistic theories   I found myself repeating many of his examples to friends and family during the time I was listening to the book and afterwards I vastly prefer fiction to nonfiction  but every once in a while  I enjoy a good work of nonfiction  and I ve come to believe that such books  when not too weighty in subject matter  make for good audiobooks  If you re interested in a subject like how the English language evolved  with influences as broad as Welsh  Cornish  Old Norse  French  Latin  and maybe even Phoenician  and what it says about culture  then and now  I would highly recommend this book as an easy  entertaining  and illuminating listen  Another wonderful book from a favorite author  What happens when the very foundation of your life is gone  Your husband turns out to be the opposite of who you believed he was  his family is the only one you ve known for most of your life and the woman who you thought of as a mother turns on you like a rabid dog  You somehow figure out how to move forward with grace only to come out on the other side being better for the experience for it led you to where you are  It was a wonderful journey and terrific listen  I love it  So informative and helpful for what I am dealing with in my life and relationship at this time  I have enjoyed listening to this series and it seems to have reached a pinnacle with this one  just released and already wanting the next one  As a huge Percy Jackson fan s  my son and I found this to be another great addition to the series  We love the way Mr  Riordan combines humor  action  and learning about Greek and Roman characters  We can t wait for the next book in the series  All we can say is  Write faster  Mr  Riordan  write faster   This book is very repetitive  The Greatest Secret is just a repackaged version of The Power of Now which was released 20 years ago    you are not your mind and body  you are the Awareness   is the central teaching of this book  and while Eckhart Tolle s books are written where every sentence is purposeful and important to the teaching  The Greatest Secret is repetitive and has a lot of  filler   The Greatest Secret was obviously heavily influenced by Eckhart Tolle  If you have ever read one of the Eckhart s books then there is no point in reading this  Eckhart Tolle explains it much more insightfully and eloquently  absolutely love this book  it s certainly quite long  but I never felt any difficulty in finishing it  because it s truly thrilling to listen to  I certainly recommend this book to anyone looking for something to occupy them for a long time  if you get bored then we might not be listening to the same book the narrator is also great  even if his women are very silly sounding  he has distinct accents and voices for each character  and astoundingly  did not seem to get them mixed up even once in over 50 hours  kudos to him  There are so many more better books on fasting  Dr  Jason Fung as an example Well laid out book  and great narration  very easy to listen to and stay engaged  Only inquiry would be that the narration mentions an accompanying PDF several times  but don t see access to get the PDF after having this audiobook in my library  Not sure what I m missing by not having it  but the info provided in the narration seems very good  and worth a couple lessons and some note taking to get to potty training  I have read all of Ellens books and each one is fantastic  What I love about this book in particular  is that she kept expanding the storyline  I never could predict what would come next  I wish this book would turn into a movie  As a person that practices ALL Religions  this is my reviewAnthony is the real deal  The information contained in these books come from a higher source that is beyond human perception and manipulation  But like all good things  you can see the writing on the wall when you read or hear what he has to say  The information in these books go against many industries and their propaganda machines  When the knowledge tips in favor of the publics wellbeing  big tech will do what it does to everyone that is a threat and cancel  deplatform and erase them from history The best thing Anthony has going for him is the powers that be thinking no one will listen to him because he is talking with a spirit  however when that honeymoon is over  all of this information will disappear like it has for many NY Times best sellers that didn t follow the political narrative of the time  When Anthony is finally censored  you will automatically know everything he said was true  Anthony is healing millions  far more than any one person or industry could do in several lifetimes Those that wish to bad things to Anthony  beware of his Earth Maw  It is also a spirit and you will only get to meet it once I have purchased all of Anthony s books and read them all  My family is finally healing after doing the medical circuit and spending 10 s of thousands of dollars getting no where  Buy buy buy before its too late  Watch his videos on youtube  fb  tt  insta  podcasts before they are taken down  If you can t find the books on Amazon  go directly to Hay House Thank God Allah for Anthony William Amen  This is a book I think everyone could benefit from reading because it addresses addictive behavior in general overeating to smoking or Smartphone dependency  Russel Brand takes a fresh and inspiring  noholesbarred approach to sharing his personal  addiction recovery story  I laughed  I cried and many times was awestruck at how eloquently he articulated the bittersweet and beautiful human condition  It is helpful and hopeful for those ready to recover  If you want something with the cheeky fun of bobiverse  the grit of warhammer  all with a dash of adventure and romance  you d be a fool to overlook this series  Its fun  its sexy  its a thrill  It truly has something for everyone delivered with an unmatched performance  Get it  Neil Gaiman nails the old tales in this book  If you re looking for great stories  impressive mythical storyscapes and a good time stop here and spend some time with the Norse Myths  Dwarfs  fallen gods  heroes  Thor s hammer  loss  sorrow  triumphs  it s all there Love the Gaiman not only provides a forward where he explains his love of the Norse Myths  but that he narrates this one himself  his passion comes through in the telling  Also  as someone who has read direct translations of the original codex I m pleased to report Gaiman stays true to the best records we have while updating the telling to be compatible with modern English  the old language can be very difficult to follow when translated literally  You ll thank Gaiman for bringing the language up to contemporary standards for you If you are interested for either educations purposes  i e what are the real myths  not the pop culture versions of Thor  Odin or Loki  or for the love of some good stories you won t be disappointed  I loved Kitchen Confidential  in part because it was the story of a punk rock underdog from Manhattan  a demographic close to my heart and history  Occasionally over the years I have wondered how success and maturity have affected Bourdain  and this book answered most of my questions  Bourdain narrates  which is all important  The chapters on the dissolution of his marriage and his grappling with fame were moving  and quite sad  I found it laudable that he has the ability to admit that he s a jerk and has been wrong about a lot of things  And the section on the fish expert at Le Bernardin is just amazingly good journalism  Yes  he can be a strident  opinionated blowhard  but I think that s part of his charm  His devotion to cooking  and cooks  is infectious  I wondered what my friends would think if I told them I read this book  There are pretty much two answers First The men usually tell me they already know ALL about this sort of thing  On the other hand  women are absolutely impressed and want to know more  It s weird because their reactions are WAY more positive than I could have imagined  Not only are they curious about what I now know  they want a copy of the book for themselves  The men they still don t get it  but I do   Once the listener of She Comes First gets past the author s nonchalant tone of speaking about such a difficult subject  there is so much to learn  I think everything is in this book somewhere  which brings me to my only problem  I ve listened to parts of this book 5 times  and I still can t find a great point in the book in which I can quickly review what I ve learned  like on my way to my girlfriend s house   It seems that much of the information is spread throughout the book  so it takes time to pick up the finer points The information is in depth from talking about discussions about transmissible diseases  to the female scent  whether cunalingus is okay while she is menstruating  to how sexual tension plays into the bedroom starting before being undressed and etc  I considered myself to be somewhat advanced and I more than quadrupled what I know about a woman in fact  I would bet I now know more about a woman than she typically knows about herself This book is a must buy for any true man  The women in your life will thank you in ways that make you feel as though you were the last man on earth If you get this audio book  if you want to skip to the good part  start the book at the 3hr 2min mark and get a taste  Then go back from the start and enjoy  I ve listened to read books on motivation  grit  goal competition  you name it  This book blows them all out of the water  It reviews ideas like hope and the way fear of hope and fear of losing hope hold us back as well as the benefits of starting the same  It s full of relatable examples and useful information  This should be required reading  It s that good  This book should come with a warning    once you start you will not be able to put down before you reach the end This is seriously the best book I have read in a very long time   I look forward to reading more books by this author I just finished Lisey s Story today  and I have to say that if this book and Cell signal a new turn for Stephen King  I m happy about it As with Cell  King is talking about bigger things within the context of horror  but with this book he s also talking about them within the context of a long marriage  This time they re the presence of love  and language and myth Lisey s Story doesn t follow the standard King map many may expect  Nobody s holed up in a cellar or a car or an abandoned building with a monster at the door  There are horrific parts and suspenseful parts  but those looking for a gorefest will probably be disappointed That may be the reason why some reviewers complained about a slow start  I didn t find it slow  however the seed of the plot is planted when the  incuncs  are introduced   Incunc  is Lisey s malapropism for  incunabula   or rare  unpublished manuscripts that are often in the author s own hand  Scholars expect that Lisey s departed husband  a writer  has left some behind and they want to get their hands on them  The scholars are what Lisey calls the  incuncs   and the book goes back and forth between their presence in the present time  and Lisey s memories of her marriage I m not a big love story person  so I almost didn t get this book  But I m glad I did  This isn t Mr  Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett this is two messedup people  both with problems  who managed to stay together and like it in spite of everything  I found that inspiring and touching Moreover  King s prose style has improved a lot over the last three decades  as we might hope    but he still knows how to tell a good story  Mare Winningham does a great job on the narration as well  Highly recommended  I d hit a brick wall  going about 180 mph  Three neighbors moved out  with all that noise  clamoring  moving vans  hustle  There were raccoons in the attic  The landlords decided that NOW would be a great time to fix up the places  complete with industrial tools  laughing  trucks  mayhem  It s still going on  and I work nights  so I m completely sleepdeprived  And have a short fuse  am liable to burst into tears if you look at me crosseyed  Oh  and then the raccoons decided that IN the walls was where they really wanted to be  Given that sleep is on the most basic of Maslow s hierarchy of needs  selfactualization and  The Universe  seemed like pie in the sky concepts But I was desperate so  despite its verrrry short content time  I gave  The Universe Has Your Back  a chance Holy cow  am I so glad I did Here you ll find the Holy Moment  living with certainty  and my favorite a 24hour challenge to yourself to find the love and live miracles Once I stopped whining about how very tired I was and devoted myself to looking for the good things  the things that were going right  once I decided to stop snapping at my husband and start letting him in  the miraculous happenedI  Was  Happy Even the overnight security guard said I was  glowing   Yes  that word  and trust me  I felt it Are you stuck  Do you judge other people  judge yourself  harshly  Is fear something that you just can t seem to let go of Give this book a try  You ll find more than mindfulness meditation suggestions  You ll receive guidelines  exercises  mantras  that you can hold onto  no matter how desperate you feel  And Gabby is so incredibly human  At a spiritual retreat  when asked What Do You Want  She says she wants a snack  a nap  no  coffee would be nice  Whom amongst us is not taken down by the everyday harshness of life  fatigue  hesitation Worth the time  worth the credit  And by the way  You re worth it too     Forgive me father for I have sinned   I just read the hottest freaking book EVER and I m going to hell for the wicked thoughts I m having thanks to Sierra Simone   My God This Book was Crazy Sexy   I loved the story  It was original  unique  seductive  risqu  and full of the forbidden The pace was perfect  the plot was brilliant and the characters were sensational A definite must read  Father Tyler Bell has just earned the spot at the top of my List He s a good guy but boy does he have a wicked tongue Not only did he say all the right things but the inner workings of his mind were even hotter  I love how Poppy brought out his beast within This story was EVERYTHING  I couldn t get enough I listened to this on audio and Narrator Jacob Morgan was PHENOMENAL   His voice fit Tyler perfectly I couldn t stop listening   I will definitely be listening to this again and again   I loved the book so much that I just ordered the paperback so I can see it sitting on my shelf  Sierra Simone has written a story that is nothing like anything you ve read before She s outside the box entirely  Her writing is the best erotica I ve ever read  There was so much depth to this story and the intimacy was perfection  Highly Recommend Wish I could give more stars than 5 because it s well deserved    I liked this book  It really presents the  act as if  mentality and has numerous ideas and behavioral suggestions to increase your feelings of well being  I did think that much of the focus was on the work place  If you are a stayathome worker you can still use the info but not everything actually pertains to your situation  However  the studies and insights are still really interesting to hear about A positive listen about choosing to be happy  Would you consider the audio edition of Matilda to be better than the print version  How unfortunate for me that I waited to age 38 to read Steinbeck  I so loved this book and immediately followed it up with his  Cannery Row and still looking forward to  The Grapes of Wrath  However  I did enjoy this one more than  Cannery Row  despite the fact that I lived five streets up from Cannery Row about eight years ago  This year I ve been running the gamut of Classics some I ve adored and others I m left wondering why anybody gave a darn  e g   My favorite has been 20 000 leagues  but hated The Time Machine  Frankenstein was amazing  but I can t finish Moby Dick Animal Farm was so insightful  but I have no clue what s going on in The Brother s Karamazov  Of Mice and Men is easily third behind two of the aforementioned both in prose and story line Gary Sinese might be my new favorite narrator  but this has been the only book I ve listened to with him as narrator where I ve listened to several books narrated by Wil Wheaton  I had no problem listening at 3x speed I m sure I will listen to this book over and over again maybe I ll add it to my list of annual reads with Heinlein s  Starship Troopers  and Plato s  The Republic and The Allegory of the Cave  I have read almost all of Rhys Bowens books  The Venice Sketchbook is one my most favorite and is an amazing book filled with twists and turns  It gives you the wonderful feeling of not wanting the book to ever end   Thank you     What made the experience of listening to Scythe the most enjoyable  I first read this book over 20 years ago and I followed the 30 days of reading each scroll  I developed the good habits it teaches  Now listening to it I realized that I didn t head some of warnings when you don t exercise your brain muscle  I m super excited to have this book in my audio library and I will take on my daily runs for about the next 10 months  Here s a tip  bookmark the chapters for each scroll and listen to that chapter for 30 days on your commute to work or during your daily exercise time  I ve listened to this book 4 times  There is so much to learn here  I m tempted to listen again  It s that important  it s that good  I highly recommend you read listen to this book  Open my eyes Lord is my prayer as a result of the information I ve gleaned here  Michael Heiser did an outstanding job of organizing and presenting ancient understanding so as to bring to light the now  seemingly obvious meanings of those difficult texts we all wrestle with as honest Godfearing children of God  A Wizard of Earthsea is the first installment of Ursula K  Le Guin s classic fantasy  Having read the Earthsea novels  five in all  plus a collection of short tales  years ago  I was very happy with this audio version  which is beautifully done  Revisiting Earthsea  it s interesting to notice how many of what are now conventions of fantasy writing were in fact pioneered by Le Guin so long ago One thing that s different about her books the writing is beautiful but spare  She can tell you in a few paragraphs what other fantasy writers seem to need long chapters to explain  Each of the Earthsea books comes in at something around 200 pages  quite a contrast to the bloated tomes of so many contemporary fantasy writers  In this outstanding and eyeopening ethnography  Matthew Desmond provided the public with an incredibly interesting look at inequality through the lens of housing accommodations for the poorest and most marginalized citizens in America  Despite studying inequality at length and reading as many books on inequality that I can get my hands on  this book really stood out because it added a level of complexity to my understanding of how inequality is maintained The writing was so exceptional  it was easy to become engrossed in the story of each person that I forgot that I was reading what amounts to a sociology book on human rights  The author did an excellent job of bringing to life the problems faced by both tenants and landlords in the slums of America In the epilogue he really tied everything together by both brining the reader back into the lives of many of the people discussed in the book and clearly connecting the dots between the stability provided by having a roof over one s head and how that stability is the only path to becoming a productive citizen  He thoughtfully questioned how high eviction rates might destabilize whole communities and contribute to crime  Desmond argued eloquently and convincingly that programs aimed at helping the poor find stable homes would be far more effective in creating productive citizens than policies aimed at punishing  In fact  putting money toward housing would be less expensive than what we pay to help these same citizens once they are fully homeless  His argument on this point was particularly salient  Similarly  it might be cheaper and more effective to help treat those with addiction than to punish them  Treatment over incarceration is something I have studied at length  which made me particularly happy to read his arguments Some of the questions Desmond tackles in this book areWho is eligible for housing assistance Who is not What are the results of these policies How do they affect the lives of poor and marginalized families who might have had a chance of living in the world in what would be considered a legitimate way How have these policies created more hurdles for those who already have such a steep climb to live a life of even the tiniest privilege  There s certainly value to be had here  analyzing different personality types and identifying if someone is trying to manipulate you A recurring theme of the book  however  seems to be that you put on an act and make sure they never figure out that you re manipulative and insincere  If you re interested in more winwin people skills books without the risk of being discovered as manipulative  because the praise is both sincere and strategic   I would recommend How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie and also How to Have Confidence and Power in Dealing With People by Les Giblin  both available as great books on Audible   Though dated  the principles remain true Another issue I have is he states that certain qualities must  appear  to be such and such  or that certain qualities simply cannot be faked  without instruction on how to sincerely develop these qualities  When you sincerely develop qualities there is no risk of being  discovered  because you genuinely have them  A great book on this is Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz  though the audiobook is a bit lackluster  I would recommend getting the book itself  Opinions on manipulation aside  there are many examples in the book which point to works of fiction as evidence rather than real world application  Other parts give extreme examples of famous figures and celebrities possessing these qualities  Examples of modern day application for the average person seem to be virtually nonexistent  and the whole thing comes off as someone who studies something more than they practice it  for example  learning from someone who writes about professional basketball as opposed to learning from a LeBron James   Plays fine at 1 2 speed but still very long  Mostly interesting biographies followed by sometimes tangential but often thoughtful analysis  or opinion rather  but a reasonable opinion except for     well  I m not into Jungian archetypes or Freudian explanations I listened to the whole book  tired just near the end when it seemed a little too much  generational differences oversimplified  death a bit much  I liked the chapter on groups and group dynamics  that s one of many I d recommend  But why such laborious biographies  Bit hard getting through some  but if you know it s half biography going in  your probably ok  I have been waiting for this book for months now  I was so excited to hear another story from a beloved series  Until the narrator ruined  It was over exaggerated to a embarrassing degree and especially during the intimate scenes it was absolutely laughable  Amazing book  but I would recommend recording it with one of the previous narrators if you want it to be successful  This one cant even compare to the last 4 books as far as narration  I enjoyed this story of family  Perhaps all families have difficult decisions within their histories  The right or wrong of any choice weighs heavy  I enjoyed the various character notations and voices of the narrators  May we all be remembered at our best  Covey describes trust as being based on character and competence  where character is required and competence is situational  He uses financial terms as a concrete way to convey the cost of low trust and the benefit of high trust  describing the former as a trust tax and the latter as a trust dividend  The quickest way to make a withdrawal  he insists  is to violate a behavior of character  and the quickest way to make a deposit is to demonstrate a behavior of competence  He goes on to detail seven low trust taxes  redundancy  bureaucracy  politics  disengagement  turnover  churn  and fraud  and seven high trust dividends  increased value  accelerated growth  enhanced motivation  improved collaboration  stronger partnering  better execution  and heightened loyalty  Covey also outlines what he characterizes as five waves of trust selftrust  relationship trust  organizational trust  market trust  and societal trust  For each of these waves  he applies the concept of the four cores  integrity  intention  capabilities  and results  and the thirteen behaviors of hightrust leaders  talk straight  demonstrate respect  create transparency  right wrongs  show loyalty  deliver results  get better  confront reality  clarify expectations  practice accountability  listen first  keep commitments  and extend trust   The book includes a multitude of practical applications and pushes the reader to reflect on his or her own behavior Despite the fact that I have recommended this book  I do so with some caveats  Although I generally like it when an author reads the book  that was not the case for this one  Covey is a Harvard MBA  but I was astounded at the number of mispronunciations  His reading style has a hesitating tempo to it that comes across as patronizing  and his incessant family examples are over the top  He s a business man  not a family therapist  Those examples got very tiresome  Still  there are nuggets in the book  Atlas Shrugged is in and of itself an amazing work  Christopher Hurt s vocal interpretative reading brings Rand s work to life  Hurt is head and shoulders above other readers available on audible com  His subtle vocal charecterizations of the various roles is excellent  Sheryl Sandberg had me at  I gained 70 lbs I had heard a lot about this book  but I really wasnt sure that I could relate to this woman  At all  I expected a book by a carefully made up  wealthy  privileged woman with an excellent education in a token leadership position  I expected someone with a lot of help who could do it all  with little  if any  credit to the people who helped her do it I  on the other hand  joined the Army for the college benefits  and I put myself through law school  I dont aspire to manage a corporation  In fact  indirectly  I work for one of the people she mentions in her book  I am an attorney  and I want to be the best litigator I can be  I am also the proud mother of two teenagers  and I worry that I shouldnt have worked outside of the home  but that wasnt a choice I had I was wrong about Sandberg  Like me  and the rest of us  she is real  Sandbergs a sociologist  a critic  a coach  a realist  Sandberg gives props to important leaders from Warren Buffet to Betty Freidan  and to her administrative assistant and her friends  Bravo  Sandberg  get out your pompoms  Tip ONeil is calling from the grave Sandberg doesnt mention Games Mother Never Taught You by Betty Lehan Harrigan  1987   but that is analogous to some of the tactics she recommends  Yes  it would be better if we  women  didnt have to bend to the  male  rules  but we do  Harrigans book is a guidebook  and as helpful as Freidans The Feminine Mystique in some ways There is a hysterically funny tale involving an eBay corporate jet and an itchy childs head  but for real fun  skip to Chapter 6  7 on audible  and listen to the first minute  Sandberg reminds us even while we should do what we would do if we weren t afraid  motherhood keeps us grounded Oh  and did I mention  Sandberg is the COO of Facebook  and she really does know what shes doing This book is fantastic  Lean In  If you found this review helpful  please click the Helpful button  Thats why I write these reviews   I have seen the movies a million times each  but have always been told the books are even better  I absolutely LOVE the Narrator  Jim Dale  He changes his voices for each character  uses various tones tocreate emotion  and keeps me engaged  I will be getting ALL the Harry Potter books  and look forward to listening to other audibles narrated by JimDale  Would you listen to A New Earth again  Why  This grabbed my attention during the prologue  and didn t let go  I have easily read 90 full novels  though most have all been in the Star Wars universe  As much as I love my Star Wars novels  I ve been wanting to expand my  space opera  collection OUTSIDE of Star Wars  I found a winner  I learned how to buy low and sell high thanks to the unique approach outlined in this Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading guide  After listening to this book for three days  I increased my earnings by 20  I kept seeing this book in a bunch of my friend s insta stories about how it was so great and  life changing   I just kept thinking  wow  what did I miss with this  But reading more of the reviews on here I see that I wasn t alone in thinking she was humble bragging and that she over simplified everything  As if  just get up and do it  attitude is all people with problems are missing in their life  Also  I found that she contradicted herself several times  This isn t always uncommon in self help or self growth books  but usually its between chapters or sections in book  where in this book one paragraph would strongly contradict the paragraph just previous I never write reviews  but this book was pretty terrible  I don t think I have ever read a book that was so hyped up  and missed the mark by so far  This was such a fun book to listen to It kept true to form for the nocturne falls series Undrea being a mermaid was well written kept the action going all through the story loved Ethan and his cat  Was great to see some of the older characters as well as some new ones well worth listening to this one  The narrator did a wonderful job again made the story go by fast very easy to understand  I look forward to another book hopefully in the future  I bought this book intending on getting to understand President Trump better  I wasn t particularly expecting it to be well written  or even less   enjoyable  What I got was a three  A better understanding of President Trump  a VERY well written book  and highly enjoyable to listen to I can t recommend purchasing this enough  I m 52 and in my second marriage  25yrs this time  and I ve never been able to express my feelings  I m like a caveman  This book helped me realize that I needed to learn how to express myself without yelling and making everything an argument  My wife is 90 right in how she handles the marriage because she read the book years ago  I was stubborn and a man who knew everything   a perfectionist  When I finally realized I was on my way to either a nonfullycommitted marriage or another divorce  She doesn t know that I ve read it but is noticing that things are changing  I can t put into words how much happier I am being able to understand and express my feelings  It s not an easy thing to get used to at all  But the author explains this in the book and I m not as afraid to do so now  I hope that it isn t too late to make amends and show her who I really am and to do my best to make the next 25yrs be what she wants  deserves and needs  She is the best wife a man could ask for  Would love to go to a weekend seminar to continue to learn more  I will be reading all of his books now because I don t want to forget how to properly treat my wife ever again Thank you  John Gray    thank you  Can I give this 10 stars  Jemisin is a freaking writing god  If anything  this was better than the 1st book  I rate this series alongside the Stormlight Archive and have no doubts that I ll be reading and rereading them both many  many times The narration was just beautiful  I love the varied accents that Miles can bring to the table My only complaint is that the audio and Kindle versions aren t synced so I had to always make sure I switched back and forth at a chapter break  That is more than a bit of a pain  This book was recommended to me by my father  It was annoying to read and even more offensive to listen to  It bases its entire logic in the idea that women only desire to be loved and men only desire to be respected  His condescending tone toward women  which is even more apparent listening to him read the book  and his assumption that men just cant help their behavior is ludicrous  I am a stay at home mother and my husband is the provider but we are STILL very much partners and both desire to be BOTH LOVED AND RESPECTED  I would not recommend this book  Alfred Molina gives a good performance  but you wouldn t know it if you were to buy this based on the audio sample  This is something I often check before buying  luckily I recognized Isaacson s funny voice and assumed it was a section of the preface The samples should give an overall impression of the narrator  not the author or other contributor in a preface  The title is very fitting for the tenth Gray Man book  In this book the Poison Apple team of Court  Zack and Zoya are split up  Court is recovering from an infected wound  Zack has been imprisoned after being identified with facial recognition brought to Venezuela by a rogue CIA employee  Zoya is sent undercover to Berlin where she is identified by Russians wha have a kill order on her  Im sure you can guess that Matt Handley will not allow Court to completely recover before calling him into service to complete Zacks mission which he does  He does and then without permission he too heads off for Berlin to make sure Zoya is safe  Of course shes in trouble and Court makes a last minute rescue Pay attention because there is more than one group of bad guys out there and they each have their own agenda which seems to involve killing at least one of the team This book is so packed with globe trotting action  It surely is RELENTLESS     Jay Snyders narration is first class This book has my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank You  A book for this current era of sedentary lifestyle and processed foods in modern day developed culture  Sal wrote on what he constantly puts forward in their mind pump podcast discussions and packaged it into a guide that we can use to constantly reevaluate our lifestyle  As well as a challenge to move away from cardiobased to a resistance training approach for meaningful results  This was a very good biography  which is something I ve come to pleasingly expect when I start a Walter Isaacson work  My knowledge of Benjamin Franklin was limited to the near caricature of him taught in school back in my day  along with little bits and pieces from various documentaries I ve watched during my adult life  I had no feeling for who the real person was behind the historical figure  Now  I believe I do  somewhat  Which  in itself reflects a good review of this book  Without going into too much of a summary of Benjamin Franklin himself  I think it s worth noting the light that the book shines on him  Ben Franklin was a practical man  A man who  when he saw a need  tried to find a practical solution to address that need  Whether it be protecting a house from bolts of lightning with his lightning rod  to helping design a constitution for a fledgling country whose states were in dire need of it  He believed in the middle class  and believed that excessive wealth  luxury  idleness and inheritable elitism was the root of much of the corruption in England at the time  He was a man who believed in religious tolerance  like many of the founding fathers  because religious dogma could be divisive  and not conducive democratic public discourse  He was a man who understood compromise and the need for it in a true democracy  Personally  he had vices like anyone else  He tended to enjoy spending time with his friends abroad better than his family back home  He often enjoyed the company various women throughout his life  to the dismay of some of his more puritanical political opponents  Contrary to many of his  Poor Richard  aphorisms  in his later years Franklin enjoyed late evenings with friends  wine  and chess  In the end  the book leaves you with the feeling that you may have known person behind the image a bit  He was a remarkable person  and this book is an excellent read for anyone interested in Benjamin Franklin  the man  and the historical figure  i think the content of the book is good    my issue is I didn t realize I was buying a book about religion  far too many times the book implies to be a good parent you need to be a follower if the Christian religion  for your children to be happy  they have to believe in Jesus  The book also implies parents must stay together for happy children  that the only reasons for a single parent household is divorce or death  that there are only traditional families  The only religion mentioned by name in the book is the Christian religion  the book would have been more effective for me at least without the heavy religious tone getting in the way  or at least having know  about it at the time of purchase  This book was a gift from my daughter who has lost 15 pounds several months ago after listening to this book  Her Husband has also listened to it and he has lost 20 pounds  They are both very trim and both are maintaining their weights by fasting So let me begin by saying  I started a diet on July 1st and told my daughter I was hoping to lose just 10 pounds  Not easy for a guy in his 60 s She told me what she and her husband had done and gave me this book on July 4th  I started listening to it that very day and finished it on July 8th  As I type this  that was 3 weeks and 21 pounds ago    One June 30th my Blood pressure was 139 87  This morning it was 122 77 There are a lot of books I really like but when it comes to practical life changing knowledge  I think there is only one book that has changed my life more than this one and that is the Bible I have never been one who fasts  I might miss a meal  but go several hours  that wasn t for me  Especially doing it for a whole day but the knowledge of how fasting benefits the body has changed my whole attitude  Before it was for a spiritual benefit that  to be honest  I never really felt  Now it is a physical benefit as well and I get its purpose Understanding the role of insulin in the body has been the key for me as I never knew what it did  how it was produced and it never even entered my mind it could be controlled  Dr  Fung and Jimmy Moore  who did a great job of narrating it  explained the process of how the body functions so clearly that I kept having  ahha  moments over and over For those suffering with Type2 Diabetes  I can t imagine what you go through  but the way this book lays out the role of insulin  I think it will give you hope  I think a whole lot of Doctors should be rethinking things For me  I do not have diabetes  so this process is right in my wheelhouse  Fasting is not an issue as I have always liked eating two meals aday or even one big meal but I have always been told it was unhealthy to do that  Now I know different and even my wife who has always wanted me to eat three times a day is rethinking that old thinking Having been on the Adkins diet and losing 30 pounds about 15 years ago  I now understand why I gained it all back  After listening to this book  twice now   I understand now how to control the insulin in order to keep the weight off and doing that in a way that fits my schedule as I eat the way I always wanted to By the way  three days ago I ate at the Texas Road House with my family and had salad with extra Thousand Island dressing  filet steak  loaded baked potato  two roles with cinnamon butter and veggies and this morning I weighed less than at anytime in the last 15 years  How is that possible  Because I understand the role of insulin and that is thanks to this book on fasting While for me it has been easier to fast than I ever imagined  I know it won t be that way for everyone so I don t want to come across like it is super easy  All I can say is for me  this has worked  is working and I understand why If you are saying   oh this is just a fad  you are wrong  This is not a fad  It is a change in the way I live my life by understanding how the body works and using that knowledge to control my weight  lower blood pressure and so many other benefits which are explained in this book Obviously  I highly recommend it and I will come back to update my story later as I still have 20 pound to go Update    It is September 8th  2019 and I have now lost 43 pounds and am at my target weight of 195  Blood pressure this morning was 115 68  Haven t seen that since I was 20 years old  I am going to hold at this weight for awhile and then try to lose 10 more pounds  It could be that im not into hiphop culture  but many of the stories left me feeling like   ok you could have said that in 1 3 of the time  The book has great points  but hidden in so much fluff  I guess I expected more of a self help book or tips  advice  something   but what it is  in fact  is her telling us about her experiences and it really felt like reading someones personal journal  There were a couple of golden nuggets in there but I wasnt really caught up in it enough to recommend to my book club or anyone else for that matter  I also was concerned about some of it not settling right with me   like I really felt like the spiritual part was not of sound teaching and could lead people the wrong way  Just my opinion  Simard s groundbreaking life s work to help humans understand trees and forests is chronicled here beautifullywith vulnerability and intelligence  bothaffording the reader a glimpse into forestry and environmental science alongside a beautifully told story of the life of a forester  scientist  researcher  professor  mother  and partner  Simard shares a story that is inspirational for our personal lives and also matters greatly for the life of the planet  Those who love Richard Powers   The Overstory  will experience joy learning more about a primary influence of the character  Plant Patty   while those who love  Finding the Mother Tree  would surely love  and should add to their list   The Overstory   I read Simard s remarkable book the first time for the personal story and am on my second read to gather all the scientific gemsI ll probably read a third time to integrate the two  Absolutely loved this book  It s one of his bests  Joel gives you some good suggestions on how to truly live in peace  Thank you Joel for helping me find daily peace in my life again  The protagonist  Cormoran Strike  is an exmilitary policeman who lost a leg during service and is now trying to make ends meet as a PI in London  His  girl Friday   a temporary secretary named Robin whom he can t afford  but can t seem to turn away  arrives on a day his life s ebb hits a low point  I loved the rapport between these 2 characters I can t overstate how much I enjoyed this novel  One would never know by the lyrical writing  the twisty plot line and welldeveloped characters that this is a debut for Robert Galbraith My only disappoint is that the book ended and I didn t have anything else by Galbraith to read  I anxiously await his next book  which I hope continues Strikes  story Robert Glenister s narration is perfect  My interest in Napoleon was sparked a few years ago by the adventures of Richard Sharpe and the Aubrey Maturin series  After rereading War and Peace  I decided I had to learn more about the background  Since then  I ve listened to a number of audiobooks about Napoleon  a surprising number of them narrated by John Lee  I had also previously read Andrew Roberts  history of the Second World War  The Storm of War  and was impressed by his writing and the organization of the narrative  The same qualities are in evidence here  We follow Napoleon from his early days on Corsica to military school in France  to Italy  to Egypt  to Spain  and to Russia  The whole of Europe became his battlefield As in The Storm of War  Roberts includes a generous helping of political history too  Napoleon scattered constitutions around Europe like travel brochures  He codified and exported laws that embodied at least some of the ideals of the French Revolution   Roberts  however  notes that the liberal tendencies of the famed Napoleonic code were blunted by its persistent sexism all men might be equal under the law  but women need not apply  The man himself was an interesting combination of engaging and repellent traits  He was a bully  certainly  and a butcher  but he also had an insatiable thirst for knowledge if a dinner guest had specialized knowledge  he would pepper him with questions and take notes  He was never afraid to say  I don t know  in response to a particular question but he would always try to find out  He was always in motion  He consumed his meals in 10 minutes  and his lovemaking was likely to be equally hurried Napoleon s spectacular rise is matched by his equally spectacular fall  His story has an inherently dramatic shape  and that comes through in this mostly chronological account John Lee is  as always  a rapid and enthusiastic narrator  And also as always with this type of material on audio  I found myself reaching for supplementary maps and diagrams in Wikipedia  I do wish PDF supplements were standard for this type of book on Audible  and that they were easily accessible through the mobile app  This technique initially worked ok however my 2 boys have a significant trauma history and this created additional triggers they didn t need  Now if I do start to count they just freak out  I spoke to our therapist who said it sends the message that big feelings are hard and we don t want you around while you deal with them so go figure it out on your own  This may be more effective for neurotypical kids but once the therapist said that I couldn t think anything else while using the technique  MKA did it again   This book has it all crime  mystery and love  Im already waiting for May 2022  The book was great  I found it better than the first  I don t care for the way the book ended  It just  stopped  abrubtly  It needed a better transition spot but it is still really good  I can t believe they are talking about 4 yrs for the next book   If I realized that  I wouldn t have started it  First let me say that I consider both Pluckrose and Lindsay brilliant  and have listened with appreciation to many of their presentations and interviews online  I anxiously anticipated the release of this book  Im welleducated and intelligent  but have no academic background in gender or race studies  or poststructuralism  No worries because Helen explains at the start that this book is meant to explain these things to the average person  exactly what I wanted I made it to chapter 6 before very reluctantly giving up  The vast amount of highly technical jargon  history and concepts were like a dense college lecture  I did learn some things  but kept hoping it would transition to more practical examples and less dense academic language  and be more like the way she speaks in presentations Ive watched   And maybe it does get easier after chapter 6   Also  so many of the excerpts Helen wrote to make her case were the ridiculously convoluted  dense  and contradictory  and often outrageous  claims made by various proponents of critical theory  Its good to know this stuff  but the bizarre nature of the stupidity does wear on you after a while  Thats not the authors fault Helen has a most pleasant voice  and theres no problem with her British accent at all  Her reading is a bit monotone  but in a nice way that unfortunately made me so relaxed I kept drifting off  However  Im keenly interested in the topic and her views This is important  valuable  very wellresearched information  I wish there was a for dummies version for nonacademics  Also  the book might work better for me in the print version  where I can put it down  ruminate or ponder or make notes  Not sure if I will try again later or exchange it  I had the previous release of this audiobook that was narrated by J  Charles  and my god was it horrible  I love this book  I had it on audio cassette that had excellent narration  but when I went digital this was one of the first books I got from Audible  And I could barely finish it  J  Charels was so bad  His  Russian  accent sounded like the Count from Sesame Street  But Scott Brick has done an excellent job on all the books he has narrated  and when I saw he renarrated this  I jumped at the chance to get it  To everyone who has the older release get this one instead  It s SO much better  I loved that the author himself did the narration  The content was excellent but the author made numerous references to the accompanying PDF  but the PDF is no where to be found  This is very disheartening because I wanted to see all these illustrations the Dr  Paul Saladino was talking about  I d already read this book in hardback before buying the audiobook  I loved it that much   and discovered that Elizabeth Gilbert s reading of her own memoir revealed new depth  humor  and poignancy  Please permit this technical note If I could have  I would ve deducted half a star from my rating on the grounds that Gilbert s voice is low and husky  I listened to this book mostly in my car  and at times her husky voice dropped so low that the reading becomes muffled or inaudible  or maybe that s just how loud my car is  It is occasionally distracting  but not overly so  This  travel  book is actually a tale of Gilbert s stripping away of the obstacles and existential plaque that had suffocated her carefully  but not thoughtfully  constructed life as a wife in the  burbs  She treats the subject of her awakening and healing with great honesty  selfeffacing humor  and a tremendous degree of likability   I found myself wishing that she lived around the block  just because it would be so much fun to share an evening and a bottle of wine with her  Gilbert s description of living  and eating  in Italy for 4 months  then spending 4 months in a Yoga ashram in India  then topping it off with 4 months in Indonesia do capture her environments  and the surrounding cultures  But this is not  strictly speaking  a  travel  book  You aren t going to hear as much about how Italians work as you are about how Liz Gilbert works  but it s hardly a loss   Be prepared to follow the thread of her selfdiscovery through a combination of woolgathering and selfreflection be prepared to learn about the spiritual path of her Guru  which Gilbert follows and explains at length in the book s middle section  And get ready to laugh out loud In summary  this book will long remain on my list of  Five books I would take with me if I had to live on a deserted island   I hope that others find it as enlightening and inspiring as I did  This story has Virginia Woolf s stream of consciousness and Walt Whitman s sensuality combined in what is probably the most beautiful book I ve read this year  Once again Michael J Sullivan gives us a free shortstory  This shorty is another Riyria tale  and is anexcellent introduction to some of Sullivans best works If you haven t tried this author  I suggest try the 2 freebies while they are still available   What would have made Many Lives  Many Masters better  I love these Shalini Boland Katie Villa audiobooks  The writing is gripping and fun and the performance perfect  They keep getting better and better This one is one of my favorites  I cant wait for the next one  Book 2 was nearly 60 hours the vast majority of followed the titular characters of Arin ans Rioka book 3 is half of that  and is incredibly divided between Rioka  Arin  and several other secondary and tertiary characters  The writing is still incredibly good and maybe some of these threads lead to something big in book 4  but I truly wish the book had stuck with the main characters a little more  still a great listen though  Holy shizz balls and cheese on a cracker   Rina Kent is going to getting forwarded some hefty cardiologist and neurologist bills on my behalf because shes just dishing out heart palpitation after heart attack after stroke with each book  Tempted by Deception was AHMAYZIIIINNNG   We got more backstory and if I loved Daddy Adrian before Im hopeless devoted for now and forever  Rina Kent masterfully peels back layer after layer from the story and characters and answers questions weve been begging to be answered only to leave us with more questions going into the third and final book  I cannot wait for that freaking ride  LOVED  I read this  but on AUDIO  Holy smokes   Jason Clarke and Desiree Ketchum are magnificent  I cannot with their performances  They bring this story to life so perfectly  Jason will forever be my Adrian and the emotion that Desiree endures into Lia is just   WOW  Im dying and dreading the last book on audio because I know its going to be one HELL of a BOOK HANGOVER   Highly Recommend  MUST LISTEN   5 stars and then some     I cant imagine who thought it was a good idea to choose a narrator who is incapable of pronouncing certain words sounds  She cant say insight but rather unsight  Not kiss but kuss  Nupples instead of nipples  Are you kidding Audible   Thai doesnt even get into the words she clearly has never heard and so she butchers the pronunciation  The story is fine  I still havent finished but Im about to stop because of the hideous narration  Please do better next time  The Law of Innocence is book number 7 in the Lincoln Lawyer series of courtroom mysteries by the 1 New York Times BestSelling and AwardWinning author Michael Connelly  I am a huge Connelly fan  as you may remember  and I was thrilled endlessly by this latest novel  With his most recent books featuring Harry Bosch and earlier this year Jack McAvoy  it was quite the time to check in on Mickey Well  he is not doing that great  Our favorite defense attorney Mickey Haller is pulled over by an LAPD officer for what at first seems to be a routine traffic stop  but  when blood starts to drip from the Linconln s trunk  things are getting ugly fast and he finds himself in jail  To clear his name  Mickey must defend his own person  playing double roles  as the defendant and council A question still stands  we all know that Mickey is a great lawyer and a decent father  but  is he also a coldblooded murderer After his excellent performance of Fair Warning  talented actor  narrator and voiceover artist Peter Giles steps back into Mickey s shoes and delivers another strong narrative experience for the listener  He infuses the story with urgency and intensity  he reads  he acts  he is 100 involved and fights for his life  just like Mickey does The Law of Innocence is another eloquent example for why Michael Connelly is one of the most respected and loved authors out there  With the stakes set so high right from the beginning  we are left almost breathless for the rest of the story  rooting for Mickey and trying to understand how he got himself in this particular situation If you like this review please consider giving it a Helpful Vote below  You can find more of them here and on theAudiobookBlog  I also post reviews at the author   narrator   publishers request  Get in touch with me for more details  This book has a few good tips  but the author is far too pretentious for me  I expected a book with communication tips  of which there are some   but the book is much more about manipulating people to benefit oneself  I started listening to this book as a distraction while mowing the lawn  Around 1030 I adjusted the speed to 1 75x so I could finish it before falling asleep  When I awoke  I relistened to my favorite scenes about a million times at regular speeds  I ve been allergic to great literature and articles this year  not having the emotional or intellectual fortitude such books require and only reading what is easy and gratifying as escapism  I was not prepared for all that this book made me feel  More beautiful and romantic for it s honesty about the cost and bravery that is required to grow oneselfto claim one s responsibility and power in becoming and to heal from painful experience by acting on its lessons  That s not to say it doesn t end with a tidy HEA  It still gave me the satisfying resolution I needed without the residual anxiety and disappointment in characters and situations that the more complex and evocative literature tends to leave me to wrestle with  Just what I needed  Highly recommended  I think this is her best yet  I really enjoyed the story  and the growth of the other characters in Jim s party was good  but I felt like Jim was a bit off  For large portions of the story  Jim seemed either like he wasn t trying  or wasn t as awesome as he was in the first books  Don t get me wrong  whenever a big bad guy showed up he would become awesome again  but then after that he would go back to before  Also  I think its good to make the other characters in the party become stronger and selfsufficient  but they shouldn t be able to catch up to Jim given his talent and experience  I kept expecting to hear Jim doing some crazy complicated cultivation technique that the others just weren t able to do  nothing against them  but a master should be capable of more  which would significantly increase his growth  but that didn t happen much  Its always a challenge in books trying to make the secondary characters strong characters in their right without  nerfing  the main character  I think it s definitely possible to write strong and talented secondary characters while still keeping Jim way ahead  because frankly that is part of the fun of the books   Anyway  it was a really fun book  but I hope the author lets Jim be more awesome again in the next book  William Greens book Richer  Wiser  Happier  is an excellently written book  In reading the first couple of chapters  it is apparent the book fleshes out years of exhaustive and thorough research on each successful investor  Not only do we get to know each investor in what made them tick  but their methods of value investing that made them successful are fleshed out in detail  I highly recommend Williams book as a MUSTREAD for any serious investor to add to their library  I have read several books on value investing  and Williams book certainly rises to the top as one of the best pageturners I have read in a long time  The audible version has an excellent narrator that appropriately adjusts pitch  tone  and even accents to quote different investors  Williams book will remain on my iPhone for me to listen to again at will as it is not only educational but highly enjoyable and an obvious work of art  For me  Ortlund has underlined the important texts about Christ s love for me  I know the Scriptures and the glory of the plan of redemption    personally and for the Church  I know theology and the great truths of the faith  I know that I am saved  justified  in the process of being sanctified and soon to be glorified  But Ortlund has shown me in substantial ways woven from God s Word just how the heart of Christ   gentle and lowly  is and has always been aimed directly at me  to comfort me  to show me the riches of his grace daily BECAUSE I am unworthy  yet it is his delight  indeed his nature  to do so  As I read Ortlund and his many quotes of the Bible and the Puritans  my sense of Who God is got bigger and my comfort with His presence more sweet    thank you for this wonderful book  Must reading for my whole family as I consider that each may have missed this too  I started this amazing book on the date is was released  February 2  finished on February 4  2021  Susan Meissner has not disappointed   I would rate this book 10 stars if I possible  Her new book was unputdownable from the beginning  I would highly recommend  I enjoyed all the twists  turns   surprises revealed in the story  We were young  beautiful  and more than affluent  Blonde haired heiress to fortune falls for boy outside her WASP class and summers with Mummy and cousins on private island near Martha s Vineyard  After a traumatic event  Cadence struggles to remember what tragedy had befallen her the summer before last Boring is the best word for this  The writing was plain  repetitive  and if I heard one more time how pretty and rich they were  I was going to reach through my iPhone and strangle her myself  Waste of my time  Would have returned it  but purchased on sale  Listen    I am going to review as someone who still has 6 hours and half to listen to  I am also talking as someone who attended the tour yesterday  DONT EVEN DOUBT ANYMORE THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU  I dont care how you landed here  The Author is so generous in this book with us  She is giving us EVERYTHING  I am mesmerized already    Professional Troublemaker is good for your heart  for your soul  for your brain  This book feeds your spirit  I feel like she left nothing behind  And like I said I havent even finished it yet  She will drag your ego while being gentle to your inner child You will not read this book just once  trust me  This is the book you will quote  This is the validation that every single one of us  no matter how different we are  have actually been looking for  This is the book to READ OUT LOUD to yourself and most importantly TO YOUR FEAR      It was written with heart full of love  of kindness  of self awareness  of authenticity  of humility  of giving    This is the book to the kid in all of us  This is the book for all generations and generations to come  I have no words  This is the book we can actually all agree on  Well except Chad and Everest of course hmmm hmmm   I dare you to buy it and if you find out I was right  come back here and share your experience too  I cannot wait to receive the hard copy    I hear it has footnotes and all  a real manual Im telling you   There is no option of finding out I am wrong I dont know who is in charge of what in this world but this book should in a mandatory purchase in your first year of college  I dont care what path you have chosen in life  Its mandatory     I COULD GO ON AND ON    I love it  I love it  I loved  Too excited to edit my feelings  I dont care  Let me just spare you from this overly condescending and judgmental book  Unless you are wealthy and can afford to have a happy bubbly stay at home mom and lots of extended family who rally around you with money and resources  you re probably not going to live up to the authors idea of what a parent i e  mommy  should be  She even has the audacity to start sentences with  not to be judgmental  but   And when she starts doing voices to narrate different persons   o my  my brain just shrinks  Bottom line  she is pro attachment which is not the same as a secure relationship with you child which can be achieved through active listening etc  etc  You don t need your in law to pay rent for a year  and you don t need to go to hotels for the weekend to spend a minimum of 24 hours one on one with your child  I religiously follow BJ Fogg do when he recommended this book I was in  I found it to be remarkable and especially helpful in coaching people with addiction who struggle with excessive chatter  Thanks  A  No matter your gender I think this book is a must  A beautiful guide on how to be a better human  Will Patton please read my grocery list and eventually my obituary thank you beautiful story great job yall  Set in the near future with a subplot on the effects of climate change  this is a totally engaging story full of drama  flawed characters  love  death  and the agonies of life at sea  You grow to love and understand the troubled inhabitants and because their story is told out of sequence  you dont understand everything until near the end The narration was outstanding and gripping and made the book come alive  Not sure why I noticed so much but the word indignantly was used every 10 minutes it seemed like which made the story not as interesting  The Body  A Guide for Occupants  written and narrated by Bill Bryson  If you are a Bill Bryson reader  you know his style and quippy manner of writing  Always a joy  no matter what his subject matter  For you  Bryson fans  just stop reading now  buy the book and add a joyful undertaking to your life  You will not be disappointed this is a full circuit informational source of data about the body  done by analyzing each system of its makeup  organ by organ  function by function  bacterium by a bacterium and done with typical Bryson lan For those of you who do not know Bill Bryson its time to learn  His writing comes with energy  style  and enthusiasm  and a smack of ironic and flip intelligence  Yet  he is always easy to understand  No high flaunting words  just good British syntax   He is an American expat to Britain   More important is the fact that when he covers a subject  he gets you all you need to know  and I do mean all the information you may need  As to the science of our bodies  he gives you in a manner that lets the layman know what a chief physician needs to know Two last points  If you are a person committed to exercising  dieting  or just an ordinary hypochondriac this is a sourcebook for truly understanding your ailment  Bill Bryson is a pretty good reader  as well  I finished the lions den and instantly started into the Siren  I personally liked the lions den a little better  but this was amazing as well  Her characters are intriguing and her plots are exciting  I really hope she comes out with a new book soon   When did  Grant  ever turn back  He was not that sort he could no more turn back than time   Walt Whitman  quoted in Ron Chernow  GrantRon Chernow delights in writing about complicated American Icons and money men  It might seem odd that Chernow would chose Grant after writing about Washinton  Hamilton  John D  Rockefeller  the Morgans and the Warburgs  but Chernow also loves rehabilitative writing  Just look at what his biography of Hamilton did  helped out mightily by LinManuel Miranda   Grant is a great subject to write about  He is a complicated man  with an interesting story  surrounded by a slew of fascinating characters  Chernow is also one of my favorite US biographers  He isn t quite as high up the biographer Olympus as Caro  who is really    but is consistently better IMHO than McCullough  Meacham  and Ellis  among the Costcoselling blockbuster biographers   Perhaps  the proper place for Chernow is next to Doris Kearns Goodwin  David Herbert Donald  and Edmund Morris This year has seen two massive Grant biographies  I m planning on reading Ronald C  White s 864 page biography sometime in the last 1 3 of 2018  This summer  I will also attempt to read Grant s own Memoirs this summer  So  I might have to come back and revise my review after reading White and Grant  For now  let me just say that Grant should probably be viewed as a great American  top 10   and mediocre president  2530   It is  however  difficult to imagine any president emerging out of the post Civil War Reconstruction Johnson years with any huge levels of success  The hostilities of the South to Reconstruction  and black engagement in the economic and political spheres practically divided the nation again  post Civil War  Northern Republicans also seemed exhauted by the horrors of Reconstruction  and largely abandoned blacks  But Grant  despite his failings in many spheres  bravely fought for the legal and voting rights of the newly freed slaves longer than almost any of his peers during that time would have  But Grant was complicated  His blind trust and reliance on old friends  and lack of experience in politics and business  bit him hard and lead to several large scandals during both terms and after his presidency Chernow avoids turning this book into a hagiography  but only just  Clearly Chernow thinks Grant s reputation gets hammered too hard for his scandals and drinking and not enough time is spent on his successes  foreign policy  fighting the KKK  etc   My other mild criticism of Chernow  besides a clear resurrectionist bent  is skimming quickly over the financial and economic implications related to the gold standard debate  see Mehrsa Bahadaran s review  and subsequent Long Depression of 187379  I find it fascinating that a writer  Chernow  with a background in heavy in financial writing and thinking  he was once the director of financial policy studies with the Twentieth Century Fund   tends to bore easily with the major financial issues of Grant s tenure But overall  I loved the book  I loved the sections on Reconstruction and was surprised to learn details about Longstreet  Lee  and Sherman that I didn t know before  I was happy to devote a week to reading it  same great book but the version performed by Carolyn McCormick are better  took me a while to realize I was listening to Nadia from parks and rec  I ordered the physical book too but I have been following Katie for years and really wanted to hear her read this  Worth hearing it straight from her  Katies message really resonates with me and its so important to change how I think and talk about my body especially so I dont pass on these issues to my kiddo  Katie is funny but also has really tactical advice  Shes been through it and her detail accounts of how she has struggled with body perception let you now you arent alone  Let me start by saying I love John Grisham Plus I love books set in Ford County  They are some of my favorite set of characters  places etc Grisham  as always  is a master storyteller and knows how to keep you hooked Plus Michael Beck is one of the best narrators Ive ever heard  As always  he does a phenomenal job That being said  this was not nearly my favorite book I do not wish to offer spoilers  but with the way the book was presented there is pretty much only one way that the book could realistically turn out  Which is what happened I was hoping for a little more Not as many twists and turns as I was hoping for  but that being said It is still a good book and well worth a credit if you enjoy Grishams writings And yes  like many others  I will probably be one of the first in line to read Grishams newest book Especially if its set in Ford County again I bought this because I truly enjoyed the Nightingale  I made a mistake There is no doubt that Kristin Hannah is a beautiful writer capable of making one feel like they are transported to a different place and time  But this book was excruciating to get through 1  Its very violent  and its all directed toward women  Its not that I cant abide violence for the sake of telling a story honestly    but this is 15 long hours of the same violence over and over annnd over again 2  Though I know that many battered women behave just the way that Cora did    it wouldve been more bearable understandable had this book been at least 5 hours shorter  Instead  after many chapters with the same scenario on loop   the reader becomes absolutely fed up with  what most people would perceive to be  Coras moronic behavior and lack of regard for her daughters safety 3  I now thoroughly detest the endearment Baby Girl     I think I heard it 3 000 times 4  For the most part  Julia Whelan is a gifted narrator  Theres just one thing that bothers me    every male that she voices sounds like a 70 year old miner  no matter what the age of the character is Wish I hadnt used a credit  I was a huge fan of the first Infinite and have been really looking forward to the sequel The story continues on from the end of book 1 but also from the end of NPC and Exo Hunter  In fact Infinite 2 is an endless tribute to the many incredible worlds that Jeremy Robinson has created  So many of his characters are referenced  its a roller coaster of shock and awe The use of Torment  another Robinson Bray collaboration  in the narrative kind of freaked me out  That book is unreal and still gives me nightmares  Im sorry  Im so sorry  shudders  What is REAL  what is a simulation  You will question everything RC Bray is incredible and his outtakes at the end are hysterical Thank you Pastor Hannah for writing this book  As a believer this book is a great resource for anyone just learning how to pray or those who have been praying for years This book has given me so much knowledge and more understanding about prayer I HIGHT recommend this book to any and everyone one that wants to JUST PRAY Okay so I automatically buy anything Helen Hardt puts out  I love her writing and she s one of my favorites But I am not a fan of Kendall Taylor s narrations  It s not her fault  Her voice just irks me  That made me almost return this after 8 chapters  but I decided to push through and try to overcome my dislike of her voice  Troy Duran saved the day with his voice  I LOVE his voice The story itself was good as usual  It just would have been better for me if it had a female narrator I could stand to listen to  Let me start by saying this is a super fun listen  Richard Reed does an excellent job of differentiating the main characters  Gustav  Emelda  Radukar  Morrvhal   There are some ancillary characters who sound very similar  but theyre not SUPER important to the plot  I think the novel couldve been a little shorter  there were some points in the middle where things felt a little repetitive  but overall its a very fun listen  I actually listened to the bulk of it while assembling the models for cursed city  which helped get me excited for the modeling portion of the game The ending has me VERY excited to get into the board game with some friends  It makes me want to buy the physical copy for the Morrvhal hero card as well Overall its simply a fun read  if you go in expecting some literary marvel  youll be disappointed  but if you go in expecting something thats enjoyable  relatively short  and youre looking for something to get you even more excited about Warhammer Quest Cursed City  go ahead and give this a listen  I know it should not matter when it comes to the lessons in this book but I have become so familiar with Brene s voice from her talks and other audio books and I could not get through the version that was not Brene  So thank you Brene for finally recording this important book yourself  I love your voice and cannot imagine hearing your stories from someone elses voice  This book is actually the best one  Out of all the books  ALL the books  I think I preordered this audible half asleep after a long time of aimlessly scrolling for books to discover  I didnt remember preordering it  and was confused when I got the notification on my phone that my preorder was ready  Looking at the cover art and reading over the description  I didnt think I would have chosen this title  It seemed so over done and blah  I hadnt read anything previously from the author and was honestly on the fence about the narrator after two other titles  But boredom hit and I decided to try giving it a listen  Im glad I did Theres something to be said about a book that takes the mundane  the overdone cliches  the things Im not really interested it  like the holidays  kids  and etc    and pleasantly surprises me  To take these things and write them so well  to give depth to the characters and have a plot that has its ups and downs without being overdone is refreshing Yes  obviously there were some predictable moments but the way they developed  I couldnt help but smile here and there  It felt real  And to have a supporting character that was a child and key element but not being annoying  wow The narrator brought just as much depth and feeing into the story as the story itself  Im not sure if I had been reading an actual book that I would have that rhythm and read the punctuations with the right effects  The pacing was perfect  The narrator definitely won me over with this listen Its a cute story  that touches upon some difficult topics without being too much or too light  just balanced  Its heartwarming really  and I feel like a sap admitting that Its not overly sexual  Theres build up and progression that isnt rushed  It just flows naturally  which seems to increasingly rare in books these days I wouldnt have thought I would like the audible this much  especially enough to finish it in a day The ending though   It felt perfectly right and yet I kind of wish there was an epilogue or a second book Suffice it to say  Im glad I bought this preorder half awake  forgotten about it  so I couldnt cancel it   and then have it a try  Like I said  the books title is very fitting for my thoughts on the book  What made the experience of listening to Detroit the most enjoyable  If you ve never read Rovelli  read this book  If you have read Rovelli and are wondering if you ll learn anything new from this book  you will indeed Rovelli fairly destroys the very popular conception of a 4D block universe  which imagines that outside of our own existence  the universe exists as an unchanging monolith of all space and time  He does this by driving home the fact that there is no present  no universal now for all observers  where observers are not just consciousnesses   Rovelli s assertion that there is no present is not new to this book  but it does come alive here  If all of reality is truly interactions interacting locally  how can there possibly be a universal now  There can not What is absolutely new here is Rovelli s genius explanation for why entropy was universally lower in the past  If you ve read any of Sean Carroll s books  you know this is the real question when asking  why does time seem to flow forward   where time here is equivalent to Rovelli s thermal time  since at base there is no time   Physicists generally agree that the arrow of time is fully explained by the fact that entropy was low in the past  But not even the mighty Dr Carroll attempts to explain this  Rovelli s answer is dazzling  You must read the book for the full explanation  but Rovelli s metaphor to an unshuffled deck of cards hits home  What does it  really  mean that the deck is unshuffled   As usual  Rovelli packs into one short book what will surely take generations to fully unpack  Perhaps I ll not be around when our children and their children fully flesh this out  But what an immensely enjoyable thing to be here  now  p New author for me Need more   Out of all the mafia books I ve devoured  this one seems more steeped in a mafia life whereas others felt more like background scenery  Loved this from start to finish  It s full of danger  action  intrigue  feels  it s hot af  and has its dark moments Stephanie s narration took a bit of getting used to at the start but her reading gets more fluid and less William Shatnery No sympathy for Mateo Trigger warning for forced sexual assault  And it s said sequels are never as good as the 1st   well NOT in this case  great story progression  character development a truly great continuation of the story  Practically the only things I can say in the negative is this   IT ENDED AND I DIDNT HAVE A 3RD BOOK TO JUMP TO IMMEDIATELY Great work Jakob  I loved this story and the narrators brought it to life  I love Gunner and Chase    They are my favorite couple  I loved everything about this book and the story had me consumed from the first page These characters I love so much  This world is one of my favorites to read Gunner will have you swooning so hard and Chase is an independent woman  put those together and you have one terrific couple   Such well written characters that you will love   Chase has become one of my favirite female leads  I can t wait to see what happens in the next book set in this world   Incredible book that will open your eyes to the millions of potential collisions that ignite innovation  belonging  and a culture of safety we all long to lead and be a member of  Pairs well with Simon Sineks Leaders Eat Last and Warren Bennis Organizing Genius  A fan of JMC s teaching and writing style  I couldn t wait to listen to this narrative and it did not disappoint  Comer s well worn teaching s on Sabbath wove their way into another book  similar content to Garden City   but the remainder was full of content that was new  insightful  educational and transformative  I took away many tangible tactical ways that I can be more like Jesus by slowing down like hiding social media apps  minimizing possessions  using a budget  not rushing while driving or at the grocery store  rewearing outfits  I hope that those ideas don t discourage you from reading the book  Yes  they are challenging but and all very difficult to do in the world we live in but Comer s Biblical knowledge and gentle teaching style allow the WHY behind the ideas to be received as an invitation to the lifestyle that you actually truly desire  to be more like Jesus and live with His easy yoke  I am excited for the challenge ahead to change habits and live in the truth presented in the book so that I can rest easier in this world and be more content with what I have  I have needed a good motivation to do this  My soul desperately needed to hear what was contained in the book because I am very burdened by this world  I would encourage every Christ follower AND every burnt out  over booked  busy person in the world to read it and be encouraged that there is an alternative way to live  Jesus wasn t in a hurry and we can find inner peace when we re not either  Thanks John Mark for using your gifts on another incredible piece  I have passed through many of the same fasting and diet strategies and fads as the author  Over the past 3 years I have gradually started fasting because nothing i had tried seemed to help me sustainably manage my weight  energy level and mental focus  Orthodox strategies all failed for me despite reasonable compliance  i am a practicing physician and surgeon who at times has to discuss obesity and weight management with patients  How could I have conviction and credibility with patients when as hard as I tried I was failing  Several colleagues told me about their success with fasting  5 2 diets and intermittent fasting  The physiologic basis for fasting is proven  I started slowly but stuck with it and have felt good and often great  and steadily lost weight I got this book because I wanted to get further personal motivation and have a really good stump speech for my patients  Dave has filled in a lot of details for me  This book is not a heavyhanded rigid unsustainable approach but rather a comprehensive gentle  realistically achievable description about how to transform how one thinks about and interacts with food to get the best out of life  If you struggle with being overweight and or fatigue and you think you can t possibly fast  or truly need to eat 3 meals a day let Dave coach you to a bunch of new perspectives  I am obsessed with biographies and memoirs  and out of the abundance that I have listened too this is hands down the absolute BEST OF THE BEST     I love this women and this couple  So inspiring and just simply amazing  Made me think of some things in my life that I relate to and would like to change  Absolute MUST READ   The information was right on  Enjoyed a first person perspective  Just disliked the cussing in the book  I had a very hard time turning this one off    I d find extra housework to do or look for traffic jams on the way to work just so I could keep listening The narrator  Roy Dotrice  is fantastic The characters in this book are amazing    We see the bad parts of the good guys  and the good parts of the bad  We get an understanding of what motivates both  and it s not always what we think  And  just as in the first two  G R R M  has no problems setting people up with opportunities to win or escape or get out of whatever mess they re in   sometimes they get out  sometimes they die  no matter how important a character they ve been   This is not a kids book  This is not the usual  you are special and need to save the world  drivel with hollywood happy endings we usually feed on    This one is more   real The story keeps moving  plenty of action  laughoutloud funny parts  hardship  and surprises Anyone who says G R R M  was only trying to make the book long  probaby wasn t paying attention  Oh Aly  wow wow wow   what a unique  heartbreaking slash heartwarming journey  that I dont want to say too much about for fear of spoilers   but  I do want to say that its an epic journey of loss and love  Two couples   best friends   one night without their kids   and only two will live to see another day  Its regret  its guilt  its grief  its loss  its love and its how to slowly pick up the pieces to live again   and to love again  because these two single parents  who once hadnt liked each other much  certainly deserved their beautiful happily ever after HOWEVER  this riveting  emotional  wellwritten story is far far more than that   with twists that rips the ground out from beneath Eason and Brees feet   with secrets that surface from the pits of Hell   with anguish and torment beating at the their door   and  with revelations that shocked them to their core  the feels were relentless  Then theres the character growth   the family dynamics between two parents and three sweet wee ones all under six   the building back of careers and lives from the ashes   the building attraction  romance  passion  trust and love   the wiping the slate clean to make new happy memories   and the beautiful natural forging of one whole loving family Worth a credit  Yes absolutely yes   the first few chapters were heartbreaking and tragic   but the clouds slowly pass in days of plods or punches   and  when the sun eventually shines again  its the right couple that evolve from the inferno into forever  It rips a bad  barely beating heart out and it sews a healthy  whole  beautiful one back together again for life and love  The dual POV narration by Connor and Erin was perfect and they certainly delivered by bringing the characters to life  by bringing the feels that flayed and floored   destroyed and crippled   flowed and flamed   shocked and shamed   tugged and pulled   ignited and combusted and together they created five star perfection  There are many good books on the WWII air war in western Europe  I have read many American and German personal accounts and some general overview books as well  This book is the best to give you a sense of what it was like to fly 25 missions with less than 5 chance of surviving  And tells you what it is like to be a German fighter pilot having to fly two or three missions a day with dwindling resources  This is all preDDay when the bombers were used as bait so the Germans would lose air superiority by the time of the invasion  There are some narratives from German civilians as to what it is like to have bombs fall all around you  The story is told at many levels from Jimmy Doolittle  yes THAT Jimmy Doolittle  down to a tailgunner sergeant  And we go from the mad man with the mustache who wants jet fighters to be bombers down to German  aces    the Germans actually didn t use that term  who watch their comrades blown out of the sky  It goes on for months and much of the book is taken up with setting the stage which is vital and informative  By the time you get to Big Week at the last fourth of the book you are a veteran and you are right there as each day brings great success and great heartbreak  You root for the various true life people whose stories are told from their diaries  It is all weaved together very well and is well done at all levels  Bravo  If you thought Brandon Sanderson had a corner on standalone epic fantasy then you re in for a surprise with this one As usual  let me start with the narrator I ve never listened to an audiobook read by Liyah Summers before  and after hearing this I can t understand why  She is absolutely one of the top talents in the business She has impressive vocal range  giving us a wonderful assortment of voices  and even her male voices are widely varied and sound amazing  Her skill with accents is likewise incredible She varies her pace to be a reflection of the events she s describing  which provides an excellent tempo throughout the book  and her vocal inflections are damn near perfect Now  as the story begins there is a bit of a learning curve as we re dropped right in the middle of several different characters in different places doing different things and it does take a bit of time to acclimate to the nuances of each character and location And I love it One of my biggest complaints about so many fantasy novels is the over explaining  I don t need twelve minutes of exposition to explain the context behind the events you re about to describe  Just describe them and let me draw my own conclusion Blessedly  there is very little to none of that in this book Samantha Shannon has built a wonderful world here with deep  rich history  not all of which is known or true   complicated political atmospheres  fascinating mythology  and some startling revelations At first  it seemed she had committed the  to my thinking  sin of making all dragons evil  But it turns out the world is a whole lot more complex than that There is a part of me that s tempted to compare this book to A Game of Thrones  as there are definite similarities  largely in that court intrigue is a massive part of the story   There is a problem with drawing that comparison  however In short  this book is better  Way better  In every way The pointless  senseless brutality  vulgarity  violence  and sexual assault are absent  What brutality and vulgarity there is always serves a purpose The storyline is way more concise  without the meandering and randomness And frankly  the writing is just better  Orders of magnitude better I can t say I m entirely on board with the magic system  as I m not overly fond of magic sources being external to the user  I have the same problem with GoT and many others   However  it is interesting Elsewise  the closest thing I have to a criticism is the profusion of matriarchal cultures societies  So far as I can tell  the world seems to have numerous matriarchies but only one patriarchy  And none that treat both gender with equal merit Don t get me wrong  I don t think fantasy needs to be all about gender equality or anything  it just strikes me as a little odd that all these human societies are so strongly weighted toward female rule In the end  whatever excites you about epic fantasy  you ll find it here We have court intrigue galore  reversals  twists  secrets  and mysteries at every turn  We have deep  rich history  epic battles  phenomenal magical items  and genuinely heartfelt moments  both sweet and passionate In short  this is the single best standalone fantasy I have ever read  You can t go wrong with this one  This is great for Dolly fans  but unlike a usual memoir it felt more like an interview with a male voice guiding the conversation without asking direct questions  It could also pass for a podcast with super short episodes aka 180 chapters of about two minutes each that could make a great daily Dollyism listening for super fans to hear a bit of her song and the story behind a song before starting a day  Best part was definitely hearing her sing bits of the songs and then explain the meaning and stories behind the lyrics  This novel captivated me and kept me company on my solo vacation to Mackinaw Island this past week  Great author looking for more from her now  Beautiful writing  dark humor  eyeopening look into the experience of the Vietnamese immigrants in America  Call me a biased Mycophile  but this was such a great book I preordered it  and downloaded as soon as it was available The pictures Merlin paints with his words are fantastic  not to mention his wonderfully soft voice that makes for easy listening   Maybe dont listen at night while driving  could be mistake for a lullaby  A perfect book for the times of isolation and quarantine as it fills our minds with the childlike excitement of discovery in our neighboring woods  I am an animal lover so stories that evolve animals are always a plus for me  I am a big fan of Catherine Ryan Hyde and recommend her books highly  This story tugged at my heart from the beginning  The characters in her stories are always so real and I was enjoying this story so much that I didn t want it to end  Ms Hyde s books are always wellwritten and there is always wisdom in her stories I was not given this audiobook by anyone and I have voluntarily left this review  love love love Hope there is a 3rd book   need to hear more  please I enjoyed this book as a graduate student in clinical mental health  I like to use the same approach and it s nice to see that others do too and found good results  It also reminded me that with trauma victims it s best to allow them a choice in their recovery I do warn those with past abuse that this book contains some triggers and to be cognizant of them when reading this book as it contains some details on sexual abuse assault and neglect  The descriptions are necessary in order to understand the treatment process  This book s subject matter is admitedly an unsavory one to most  however  it is considered in some circles to be a  classic  work and so I resigned myself to reading it  I am glad that I did  I was surprised at how completely I was drawn into the story  This book is very well written and deserving of the serious reader s consideration  A few random opinionsThe sample doesn t do this book or narrator justice  Although I bought it because I am a lover of psychological thrillers and mysteries   and to me this wasn t really either one  it was so good  and had such great character development that I loved it  And last but not least  if I had realized sooner that this was from the same author as  the things we keep   I think that s the title of the Alzheimer s story   I probably would not have bought it  because I really didn t enjoy that listen   but to me  this is a much better story I highly recommend this book for lovers of really good books and great characters   regardless of genre I often disagree with Matt Taibbi but find that everything he writes is worth reading and giving strong consideration  I agree with most of HATE  INC  I do wish  however  that in this book that he had focused not just on MSNBC and Fox but also on CNN which is just as guilty as the others  Taibbi is from the left side of the political spectrum and I am fro the right side but we both have libertarian leanings so maybe that s why we see much of politics and journalism in the same way  Most of all I like and appreciate Taibbi s honesty even when I disagree with his perspective Hate  Inc  is an important book about US politics and journalism that deserves a huge audience  Every few years  Malcolm Gladwell publishes a fascinating  engaging book on an overarching sociological concept  He started in 2000 with  The Tipping Point How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference   defining that point as  the moment of critical mass  the threshold  the boiling point   Gladwell isn t creating trends  as the subjects of his 2008 book  Outliers The Story of Success  do  Gladwell  after extensive research  gives the concepts names and stories everyone can understand  David and Goliath Underdogs  Misfits  and the Art of Battling Giants   2013  is a collection of stories about people who do things differently  either because they are different or because they have no choice but to ignore  conventional wisdom  to fight and win  Gladwell provides many examples of underdogs using unconventional warfare Irish Catholics a girl s under 12 basketball coached by a dad who d never played the game The Reverend Dr  Martin Luther King and the American Civil Rights Movement      By illustration  Gladwell tells the story of Emil Freireich  an oncologist and an incredible social misfit in the pediatric oncology ward he worked in  Dr  Freireich s inability to let emotions into his work  and his ability to think beyond common practices  made him instrumental in finding cures for childhood leukemia  Hundreds of thousands of people owe their lives to a man with the bedside manner of a gruff truck driver who has had one too many coffees and still has five hundred miles to go before the sun rises again Gladwell also points out the loss that can happen when someone tries to fit in the wrong place and wrong time  He illustrates that concept using a woman who went to an Ivy League university and lost her passion for science among all the  big fish  in the competitive shark classes  If she d gone to a state university  which actually had more qualified  published professors  she would be living her dream now  I have two teenagers  and that resonated with me  My oldest  inculcated by the mantra of  you must get into A Good College   wonders if I know what I m talking about when I tell him I want him to find a school that s good for him  Now I ve got backup Gladwell s books are occasionally fiercely criticized by the scientific community  because they are too general or because someone believes he has misinterpreted studies and data  Those are valid points  but Gladwell isn t writing a peer reviewed article for publication in  Evolutionary Behavioral Science   He s writing for everyone  not just PhD s and MD s  and he s writing to start a conversation  not answer all questions I ve heard Gladwell in interviews  but this is the first Audible Gladwell book I ve listened to   I have the rest of in hardback  and my favorite is 2005 s  Blink The Power of Thinking Without Thinking    Gladwell is a great narrator The Audible comes with a PDF file with a photo Gladwell discusses extensively in the book charts and graphs and footnotes  If this review helped  please press YES  Thanks   Acuff ought to secure a Grammy for this new beat its sure to become a classic  Flippin coins and modulating your personal soundtracks from minor to major keys are concepts I plan to use personally  professionally  but most significantly in my mentoring relationships You can take this one to the bank and cash it in because its going to pay dividends  but be sure to ask for it in half dollars   Thanks for putting pen to paper and bringing my internal soundtracks to life so I can retire the old classics and spin a catchy new remix  The story continues from the first book with relative ease without having to get into detailed explanations and long drawn out specific of each character  The author focused on the continuing the story which was fantastic  I cant what for the next book  Narration was good but I feel like the female voices could be a little bit more distinct  This is a must read listen for anyone interested in pioneers of the Great Plains area of Canada and the US  Cather s descriptions are extremely wellwritten giving a great sense of place without excess wordiness  Her characters as well are developed through their deeds  actions and words without volumes of text to support them As a result  the characters become  real  humans  filled with loyalites contradictions and dilemmas of everyday life  Finally  this book recalls a time when the influence of a natural landscape was most profound  Fans of prairie and pioneer history will truly enjoy this classic  What did you love best about The Viscount Who Loved Me  Recounts in great detail the over century long colonial project carried out by Zionists and their imperial backers to dominate and replace Palestine with a Jewish state This is a fun and interesting look into a genius that thinks he s both the greatest detective to ever live     and related to Sherlock Holmes  And for very short intervals  he really  IS  the greatest detective on Earth  I was expecting another take on the Holmes saga and something done in that Sherlock style  This wasn t really it  But it is it s own interesting story line and has possibilities There are several bits that foreshadow future adventures  and I for one am on board for the ride Looking forward to the next adventure  Should be fun to see what Drew Hayes has in store for us  The book will hit you at a visceral level and be prepared to listen to it beyond your normal listening routine  It s not a history of the war  The war is treated as a background character to the machinations of the political intrigue that transpired The book is a series of stories with a narrative that ties them all together  Be prepared to listen to 8 or so hours about a single topic such as the run up to the incursion of Austria or the invasion of Poland  The book is not a set of sound bites but is mostly exhaustive details on the political intrigue surrounding the topic Why can t all readers be as good as Grover Gardner I had ran out of science books on audible to listen to and had low expectations for this book  My expectations were wrong  Here I am 2 books later and almost 50 hours later and the plot has barely progressed  A full trilogy could have been completed in the time it too to get through Crown of Thorns and Path of Dagger  I m committed but I really hope it gets better soon  less sniffing and clothing description and some actual story progression  Has been the best read Ive listened to during quarantine  Scientifically rigorous and riveting the whole way  Highly recommend  Anna is my favorite narrator  This is one of the best books Ive read in years  I stayed up late listening because I just couldnt turn off Annas voice  Her voice is calm and soothing and makes me feel at ease  Write more books Anna  IsraeliAmerican actor and producer Noa Tishby has written with ISRAEL what could be an important proIsrael and proZionist book if antiZionists would read it with an open mind  But they likely will not  Nevertheless  I appreciate her openness and honesty as well as her clear writing style and her superb narration skills although I fear it is all for naught  It is not nonJewish Zionists like me she needs to convince ISRAEL includes lots of history in a book that is also intensely familial and personal  I hope it will get the wide readership it deserves  This is an ARC review  All opinions are solely my own Off the Record is book 3 of Kristen Proby s With Me In Seattle Mafia series  This is a very fast paced series that has to be read in order or you will not understand all the players in the story  This book is narrated by Jason Clarke and Erin Mallon  The way these narrators embody the characters makes the listener feel like the characters were written for their voices Rafe and Annika have tried to stay as in the shadows of their family businesses as possible  But when the business comes knocking on their front doors they are forced to confront their pasts  These two have been fighting their feelings even longer  Now that each are unemcumbered they can explore what their hearts have always known Kristen Proby is the master of intertwined family and friend romances  I love the way she blends each book seamlessly together  I will always come for a Kristen Proby series  I was drawn to this book for three reasons 1  its a Tana French mystery  2  the main character is a former Chicago cop  I was born  raised in CHICAGO  knew several police officers as I am a former Paralegal Assistant  3  It takes place in Ireland  a place I always thought Id love to live  All my expectations were fulfilled  While Roger Clark is not one of my favorite narrators  the story grabbed me  pulled me in immediately  The setting is richly described as the isolated  often dreary place it is with air so clean  fresh that merely breathing it doesnt seem enough  Roger Clarks Irish accent of some characters is spot on  Thats his redeeming quality to my ears  The story is amazing  Its a bit long but worth sticking with it  There is some profanity in the book so be aware if thats a deal breaker for you  After all  the main character is a rough  tough former Chicago cop  It is definitely written from a mans man point of view  Tana French is so good at that  Another great Tana French novel  I loved this story  This is so so good   in fact I think its one of her best   maybe because of the duetstyle narration which brings it up to a whole new  and very entertaining  level and makes the interactions and banter flow smoothly  This is how a Bratva Kingpin claimed his Queen For five years Art School Teacher Natalie has mourned her Fianc who went missing just before their wedding rehearsal and her lifes been in limbo since then with questions of what happened to him haunting her days   and not even her bff can snap her out of it  Then  on a rare night out  Natalies eyes land on a handsome  sexy  hot stranger whose charisma and intensity fades the world around her  Kage is possessive  dark  dangerous  deadly and is the Shakespeare of the dirtiest smut   hes also got a suitcase full of secrets  Oh yea   and hes rooted deep and high in the Russian Mafia   a Kingpin who doesnt want a Queen She was just meant to be a job but  for once  Kage just couldnt pull the trigger   or get her out of his mind   or stay away   or tell her her truths  And he becomes a obsessive  possessive alpha who knows Natalie is his   and  when these two very different people agree to what theyre willing to lose and what theyve got to gain  its nuclear sexual fusion  He doesnt claim to be a good man   he wont answer many of Natalies questions   he is a demanding lover   he comes with secrets and strings   but he promises never to lie  Kage may be good for Natalies dormant libido but hes bad news for her equilibrium and  when Natalie says yes to his touch  she seals her fate  Natalie is sassy  fierce and feisty and her strong attitude brings the  bossy side out of Kage  What follows certainly wont be a fairytale   however it will be hot  heavy and will have lite bdsm in it   along with suspense  dead bodies  humorous snappy smooth banter  delicious friction  mystery  twists  revelations and a happily ever after Worth a credit  Oh yes  I loved every single intense second of it and the duetstyle dual POV narration was perfect  And the friendship and easy banter between Natalie and her best friend Sloane was great too  If  but only IF you care about your wellbeing and the wellbeing of those you love  you ll not only listen to  or read  this book    you ll actually pay attention to what its author is telling you and you ll eat ONLY good  whole foods  By protecting your liver and feeding your gut  as the author reminds us  you ll be on your way to better mind  body  spiritual health  It s true  I m a former obese person    a junk food junkie    a fast food feeder    a soda drinkaholic    who suffered huge physiological problems that nearly took my life  How hard is it to ditch the poisons and heal oneself  Not as hard as trying to recover from some really scary health issues Get this book  This book was seriously amazing  I wish I would have listened sooner  It is full of amazing advice and real life stories of actual twenty somethings  I want to listen to it again just to make sure I didnt miss anything  I loved that it was read by the author as well  Everybody needs the message in this book  I have to admit  I m a Liz fan  and still I was blown away by her words Thoughtful  caring  concise  pallette cleansing   easy listening  and love are a few words that I d use to describe this book  As an integrator  it has been difficult to find the right visionary  Once you find the one the business world becomes a great playground Any business owner should read or listen to this book as it helps to clarify your roles simplifying your day in a way that by playing to your strength you can achieve many great goals Works incredible  This book given me a chance to take a gander at things in a radical new viewpoint and opened my eyes to new potential outcomes  Thank s Kevin has been one of my favorite comedians since I can remember  You can always tell when there is more to a person than their main act  Thats definitely true for Kevin  This man knows his sh t I never thought Id look at Kevin as a motivational mentor but he definitely is now  If you could see my Audible library  youd see I have hundreds of audiobooks and its filled with about 95 leadership and motivational selfhelp books  Id rank this in my tops 3 books on Audible    And definitely top 1 book for being the realist  Thank you Kevin for putting this audio together  I really wanted to like this book  and so much of this was curiosity as to what writing looks like from someone who may have climbed on the shoulders of his brother his own fame  What does writing look like when your debut has that going for you In the end  I am not convinced this would have been published if it were written by someone without Hank Green s background It s not bad  It is just not something I would expect to be a beat seller with multiple translations and an audiobook  It s something I would expect would land you three stars and a selfpublished sequel The characters are like the characters from  Crash   They almost have their roles more than they are people  And the background for the main character is almost a satire of a modest waif  That s not impossible to work with  but it seems like Green was more interested in having a plucky personality than a person as a main character  Her being Bisexual only transiently has an impact on the story  Her being  hot  by her own description is hardly remarked upon  unreliable narrator  unclear   She and her friends are JUST conveniently knowledgeable to move the plot forward that I would not be surprised to read that they were mind controlled in the sequel The best thing about this book is the wit  Green takes from John Scalzi and really makes you feel comfortable listening to April May spell things out  I give the performance a 5 5  but Green s writing shone with April s narrative  I would not be surprised to hear Green wanted to write a book about April being the focus of first contact  but then not focusing on anyone or anything else  His passion was April as a narrator  I feel  and the story came second Overall  I would say I enjoyed the listen  The story has just enough mystery as to hold you  and the pluck is just heartwarming  However  the plotholes  especially the first chapters   the stereotypical robotic characters  and the lazy dialogue all make me wonder what better writers have had their books rejected for smaller flaws and better stories  I really expected a knock your socks off book considering who wrote it What the book is a series of stories of people using social media to advertise their business or get started on a business What its not a how to book  It is a bunch of ideas  but not a bunch of steps  The introduction talked about a couple different businesses and which social media platform is best for that but that was really only cover through very specific examples Here is the whole book find your passion  Connect with others through social media  Be yourself and let your personality shine through  Use every platform out there  Maybe youll get lucky and the right person invites you to do something for s big company that you might get paid for  Contact people  Post more content  Contact them again  Post even more  Cross fingers  There are a lot of redundancies  repeating the same questions to each person  that become annoying fast on audio  while you will easily look over it on text Also the QA dialogue style is more confusing on audio  especially when it s the same men reading and answering the questions  He did a good voice acting though  I tend to listen to audiobook for at least 30 minutes to hours straight  and with this book of dense advice delivered fast it gets overwhelming  So I think I will enjoy it more on paper  to pick up a chapter or two on the fly  Jamie Wheal has written the soulful  insightful  and actionable book that our world so needs in this specific moment  Rich with mind blowing information  heart melting sensitivity and galvanizing purpose  Recapture The Rapture takes a sweeping inventory of the current state of the world and provides with brilliant guidance a plan of action  This book is a defibrillator for the dysfunction of the human heart and our ailing world  enjoyed it hope there s a sequel with babies even fast forward lol next generation Im currently neither a proponent nor an opponent of critical race theory but I wanted to get an overview of the theory on its own terms  This book is a very accessible and detailed introduction  It has an academic style that seems to have been intended as a university textbook  As an introduction it is heavier on exposition than argument  I was pleased to find that it was more informative than persuasive in its presentation  mostly just presenting the issues and laying out the various positions on points of disagreements  both among critical race theorists and between critical race theorists and its critics  The advice is priceless  Haven t heard from her yet  but I m positive she ll be back  i have a whole lot of homework to do  But changes need to be made  even if she doesn t want me back  I will have this powerful knowledge to have in my corner  Esther Greene I m lucky to have stumpled on your work I was pretty lost  thanks darling friend  love the story  rick riordan is a genius  but the narrator  joshua swanson  repeatedly pronounces names  places  etc  the wrong way  and somehow when he is reading  he tends to make otherwise very interesting characters sound bland and unimpressive  overall  i love the book  as i love all the books in the Percy Jackson universe  but the narrator was very disappointing  This book has some really great content if you like books about reincarnation and life after death  But i would recommend reading it instead of listening to it  Why  Most of it s written in case study format  which i imagine looks like this  what i ve written below is meant to be illustrative and not actual quotes Dr  N  Tell me what you saw  Patient X  A bright white light and people  Dr  N  Did you recognize any of them  Patient X  Yes  I saw my father and my uncle George  And this goes on and on for each case study  of which there are well over 20 While this format is fine for reading because your brain just sort of skims over the  Patient X  and  Dr N  parts  it is rather annoying to hear the narrator constantly say  Patient X blah blah    Dr  N blah blah    Patient X   blah blah  And so on The narrator does a fine job with what he s given  but it s just not good for an audible book  It took me a while to get used to the fact that this story was being told through letters  which the mother had written  At first I thought   How could this possibly work   But  it does  By the end  it all comes together as to why the story is being told through letters  It kept my attention the whole time  If you want a chilling  psychological disections of a family  blessed  with a psychopath for a son  then you ll LOVE this book Narrarator was excellent  I m sure I m not the first person on here to say this  but I now have ZERO desire to see this as a movie  There s no way it could live up to the book  Very well done  Dr  Brewer is a fantastic narrator  I find his voice soothing and genuine  I have used the App Unwinding Anxiety and found it truly life changing  I would never have considered myself an anxious person until I started to untangle some sticky habits  The science backs up his method  I have changed so many habits from using this program  I thought having a couple of glasses of wine several times a week was fun and social but it lead me to over eat and and a bunch of other behaviors I didnt enjoy  When I started actually asking myself  What do I get from this  Feeling into my body not using my thinking mind   it became so easy    no force  no struggling  I now have a glass of wine probably once every 4 months because I want it not because I think I need it  Dr  Jud not only talks the talk but he walks the walk and is patient  kind and the real deal  I would never have believed that I could learn to work with my anxiety from drinking  insomnia to control freak level planning    this has given me back my life  This has changed my relationships with my husband  children and friends on a level I never thought possible  This is the best book for truly embarking on a life with less anxiety and more peace and ease in life  I ve noticed trends in a lot of the YA scifi books that I ve read  particularly those with a strong female lead  and this series follows all of them  It has the usual love stories  and the usual rise from the lower class  and a strong female protagonist  which to be clear  I always enjoy  AND  this book still managed to give you a plot line to love  even though you ve kind of heard it all before  This particular book shows how much Aelin Galathynius has grown and how strong she truly is This book was extremely sexual  more so than any of the books prior  and I would not recommend it for the 1113 age group  There were many sex scenes and sexual conversation and situations  so I think parents should use their own judgement I m thrilled with this book  I wish I waited until the next book in the series was also released  because this is a doozy  Another wonderful entry in this fantastic and criminally underrated fantasy epic  I m reminded again that Peter Kenney is one of the best  and certainly the most versatile  narrators I ve ever heard  I LOVE THIS SERIES  AND THIS BOOK DID NOT DISAPPOINT  SOPHIE AND COMPANY ARE BACK AND INVOLVED IN ANOTHER MURDER OR TWO OR    AS ALWAYS  THE STORYLINE  THE NARRATION  THE CHARACTER INTERACTION WERE SUPERB  NOW COMES THE WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK  Apparently this was based on an older work of a very similar name  but they decided to get with the times and refer to people implementing these principles as  new  one minute managers  The main change  as near as I can tell without referring to the original  is to speak of giving people  one minute redirects  instead of  one minute reprimands   Nice This very short work is written in fable format  but the veneer of story and plot is fairly thin  So thin  in fact  that the protagonist doesn t even have a name  He just asks around and discovers everyone that works for the  new one minute manager  loves working for him so much and has SO much free time  Yeah  that s realistic  This wise  much loved manager managers to make the protagonist uncomfortable with a nearly hostile attitude multiple times in their first brief meeting   Ah  but people don t read business fable books for the story  do they  What about the contents  Well  it seems to boil down to this1  Write each of your major goals on a separate piece of paper  This is made abundantly clear  They MUST be written down on paper  Each goal on a separate sheet  because somehow that helps you to keep track of them  Apparently they aren t ready to move with the times enough to move beyond paper 2  Praise employees often for doing good work 3  When employees need to be corrected  indicate what they need to do differently  and offer encouragement for their growth Keep track of goals  praise people  correct in a motivational manner  Not bad  as far as that goes  Managers should do these things  It s pretty basic as far as it goes  Perhaps there would be more value going in depth into these principles  I feel explaining how and when to give praise  and most of all the right ways to give criticism  could be really valuable  But alas  we largely fly by those topics here It s so short you might as well give this a listen  assuming you don t have to spend an entire Audible credit on it  But don t expect a lot of value from it  This book is dark and dangerously good  I love that Roxy is just as badass as the Viper brothers  She s not a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued  She goes in punching and she punches hard  The Viper brothers are all possessive male who protects what s theirs and Roxy belongs to them in every sense of the word  Being trap in their world  Roxy gets to know each brother and their demons just as they get to know hers  Through it all  she thought she could escape their grasp but instead  they fall for each other deeper I love the multiple POV s  Getting to all their perspective allows you to understand their actions and emotions  I love Hollie Jackson s narrating  She s awesome  I ve listened to her other audiobooks and she never fails  Cornell Collins does a great job  but I don t think he s a good fit for this book  I know several male narrators that would have been a better fit Darkness 5 5Steam Heat 5 5HEA YesCheating No After listening to another work by this author that was just outstanding  The Nightingale   I grabbed this one without much research  I thought for the first several hours that I made a mistake  The story starts so slowly and initially felt almost a bit like an immature romance novel trying to masquerade as literature  But then the story came to life much further in than I had anticipated and it became allconsuming  It did a complete 180 and morphed into one of the most heartbreakingly beautiful stories I ve ever read  So if you have the patience to suffer through a somewhat monotonous buildup  the effort will pay off in the end  I eventually felt like my entire day became about when I could get back to it  I longed for the story when I wasn t listening  It s a beautiful and emotional story that will make your heart break over and over but it will also come around to an ending that is a precious treasure A word of warning since becoming a mother  stories where children suffer have become exponentially more upsetting to me and this story had some elements that were so far over that line of discomfort that there were times I wanted to stop  I wouldn t recommend this to a new mother or someone struggling with PPD or someone who was in mourning  The story comes around to a beautiful place but it trudges through some of the most painful hardships to get there  Ultimately I m glad I stuck through it but my daughter is about to turn 2 and if I d tried to listen to this in my earlier  superhormonal  new mom days  I don t think I could have finished it  Don t forego it completely  just wait until you can handle it if you re feeling emotionally delicate  Recently  Steven King said that Salem s Lot is his favorite of his novels partly because it s about small towns which are rapidly disappearing from rural America  It was his second novel  the first is Carrie  but years later it still holds up as a first class vampire novel The voice performance is also top notch  but I ve always been a sucker  pun intended  for Simon  Schuster audiobooks  Welcome to Salem s Lot  Highly recommended  As I run through Frank Herbert s original Dune stories  I think the best adjective for the flavor and pace is  operatic    a good story with great color and flavor  but paced slowly  Much of the book is spent with people talking about what will before much of anything does happen  That doesn t mean it s boring   understanding the motives and machinations of the principals really are the story  but it s an unusual flavor for scifi For those who are not familiar with the previous works  this won t make sense  You need to do them in order This story centers around Leto II and Ghanima Atriedes  the children of Paul Muad Dib and imperial heirs presumptive  now aged 9   Alia  their aunt and imperial regent  and the Lady Jessica  mother of Alia and Paul   Alia is struggling against the inner voices from her ancestral memory  while Leto and Ghanima try to avoid the same fate  The mysterious  blind Preacher only adds to the mystery Part of the vast Duniverse tapestry  Children of Dune doesn t live up to the high standard of the original Dune  few books by any author do   but improves on Dune Messiah Excellently narrated by Simon Vance with an assist from Scott Brick  Very entertaining read  Marc Thopson wow  You just cant beat this guy as far as readers go  He took a really good book and made it that much better  If your a star wars fan this is a must read and if not read it anyways you might become one  Just when you thought this series of books couldn t get any more fantastic  the author steps up to an entirely new level  introducing characters and concepts that are admittedly pretty advanced for youngsters  although my 7 and 11 year olds absolutely love these books   For early teens  it is a perfect introduction to philosophical and ethical ideas that require some serious thought  The nature of religion versus dogma  the concept of self  the idea of power of selfsacrifice  the portrayal of multiple realities  all are explored in new and fascinating ways The audio production of the entire series is topnotch and riveting  and has resulted in my driving around the block many times just to get to the end of the next chapter Contrary to claims that this book is antireligion  it is more a criticism of political authority  ignorance  and power  This is not the God of our world  this is an alternate universe  The church in this story is a repressive political entity that relies on fear and intimidation It is frightening to see how many people fear these books and wish to ban them rather than to see them as a starting point for discussion of ideas  do not underestimate your children and their ability to comprehend these ideas   These books do not challenge anyone s faith  it really points out the the pitfalls of blind faith versus the true power of actual deeds  Pulling these books out of libraries as some wish to do would be a tragedy  and it seems to reflect more of a lack of faith in one s own beliefs than anything else  I was sucked in from the very beginning  The first scene when Truman and Sam meet melted my heart and cry with laughter  I could see the bee suit in my head  I loved getting Truman s story and Sam was a teddy bear with scruff I loved the conclusion to Truman s trouble even if I did predict who done it about half way through June can t come fast enough I need more aster valley after that epilogue  Hot as Heller is going to laugh of loud amazing if that first confrontation is anything to go by  This book is amazing  you have three woman who agree to meet after a DNA test  Turns out they are half sisters that live in three differant parts of the USA  Now move forward 6 months out they are meeting for a week at Lake Tahoe  California in a cabin  Brenda has written a well developed storyline with many twist and turns  You have believable and likeable characters that flow well with the storyline  You have Lorilie a stay at home Mom  Serenity a novelist  and you have Reagan who is in advertising  All three of the sisters have personal issues in their own lives and appear to be falling apart  You also have Lucy  Lorelie s daughter who is cute as four year old children are  She has a tendency to say what is on her mind  The sisters are bonding and agree to extend the time in the cabin for the summer while they search for answers as to who their father is  This book is written so well you will not guess who the father is  It is totally unexpected and not something I would guess  Erin Bennett does the narration so well she maintains your interest  I highly recommend this book  The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice can only be fully enjoyed in the unabridged versions as the unfolding stories of the whole series are so complex and interconnected  Facts and incidents missing from any of the first books detract from the understanding and enjoyment of those following on Simon Vance is as always an excellent narrator and in  Interview with the Vampire   strikes just the right voices for the characters  Serious  sad Louis and wild irresponsible Lestat came to life perfectly as I had imagined  If audible brings us the  Mayfair Witches  in unabridged versions also that will be an added bonus Highly recommended to those already addicted and to listeners new to Anne Rice s work  these are the true vampires  don t expect tender romance or vegetarian vamps here  I ve read this book many times  but this is my first time listening  The narrator reads in a dull  monotone voice that took me out of a story I love very much  I wouldn t recommend the audio book version  I am so thankful to have  stumbled  on this Audible recommendation  It was on sale  but after listening a few minutes I knew it was priceless  There is no way to  pay  for something whose value cannot be summed up  A treasure  I have enjoyed many audible books before  but I ve never felt compelled to write a review I had never read Anne Frank s Diary of a Young Girl  I assumed that I knew what it was about and that her diary entries would not hold my attention  I was mistaken on both accounts I looked forward every day for a chance to listen to the book  Anne Frank wrote with such emotional candor  eye for detail  and ear for conversations that I found myself wondering many times what she could have written if she had lived  I never grew tired of listening Selma Blair s reading is superb  Other readers might have just conveyed the intelligence and the eye of Ms  Frank  Ms  Blair goes further  She captures the adolescence quality of Anne Frank  the  young girl   the petulance  the exasperation with the adults in the annex  through welltimed pauses sighs  laughs In Los Angeles  where I live  The Museum of Tolerance has a letter that Anne Frank wrote to a penpal in the United States  It is a tribute to Audible and Ms  Blair that when I read the words of the letter  I heard Ms  Blair s voice reading them in my mind  You can save 10 and just listen to her podcast  Its the same info even many chapters are question an answer format I was excited hoping the book would go deeper or be better organized but its not  Its just her podcast stung together in chapters  I wouldn t call myself a fan of Tony Robbins but I appreciate his work  knowledge  spirit and incredible business sense  I was looking forward to this book since Gary Vaynerchuk had him on his daily YouTube show and openly endorsed it I should not be able to summarize an entire book on money management in one sentence  but it s possible here   Invest early  let compounding interest work for you   diversify across asset classes and industries  use index funds for vast majority of your investments   don t let the market corrections and bear market shake your confidence in your investments  in fact  invest more during these times as everything bounces back there  I just saved you hours of time  money or a credit  Don t believe me  Listen  but I did warn you  Lindsay Crouse was superb  Stephen King was absolutely amazing  This guy can write anything  Kudos  This book is a postcard from the past  a fascinating snapshot of life in America in the early 1960s  Steinbeck s writing is lovely  but Sinese makes it absolutely come alive  His portrayal of the different characters that Steinbeck meets is impressive  hard to believe that he is the only one narrating the book  But the best part is the totally authentic voice of Steinbeck himself  I felt like I was there with the man himself  and Charley  Beautifully performed  Who was your favorite character and why  Enjoyed listening to the first two books but if I hear the British pronunciation of the word grimace one more time I ll scream  This is a fantastic sequel to Jurassic Park  Great technical discussions  a fun  exciting story   which had minor flaws  as other reviewers have pointed out   but it s about dinosaurs   If you can suspend your disbelief when it comes to the dinosaurs  then why harp on the character s flaws  Go with it My brother got this for me when it first came out  and I loved it so much  I have since read almost all of Crichton s other novels  And if you have seen the movie  please don t let its lousiness detract you  This novel is not like the movie at all  And it s got Dodgson  a much better villain than the 25 Marlboro men and Hammond s nephew that were in the movie  and nowhere in the book   With all due respect Mr Spielberg  exactly which parts of this book did you actually read Scott Brick  you are the man  please do an unabridged version of Jurassic Park  so I can enjoy an audiobook of the only Crichton novel that is possibly better than this one  I loved Harry Potter and have revisited the books and movies many times over  And I adore Stephen Fry  But I didn t like this book It starts as a rather heavyhanded treatise on class differences in society  showcasing how people with power can talk themselves into ignoring their feelings and thus justify being unfair  or worse  for their own comfort  It may change course further on  but right now I just can t take any more of the issues I hear about in the news every day  So many of my favorite fiction authors have turned their novels into pulpits  addressing some societal issue they feel strongly about  I find I usually agree with their position  but really wish they would continue to create fictional worlds where we all can take a break from the bleakness and cruelty of the world as it exists right now The worst thing here is that the story is told rather than shown  and the humor  charm  and deep characterizations that I fell in love with in the world of Potter are definitely MIA  I expect I will be in the minority with this review  but another seven hours is more than I can manage  Did not finish and returned  As someone who had virtually lost hope in finding a way back to metabolic health and was getting worse after trying a number of diets and regimens  Dr  Fung s  The Obesity Code  semimetaphorically saved my life and I can t count the number of people I have recommended it to  That said   The Diabetes Code  stands head and shoulders above  The Obesity Code   This book is remarkable in the amount and quality of information delivered and the simple  easytounderstand language of Dr  Fung  He makes complex physiology very accessible and actionable  Having read many of his blog posts and listened to podcasts and lectures by Dr  Fung  I had very high hopes for this book and it far exceeded my expectations  Absolutely fantastic  Ryan is a great story teller  which I am sure comes from learning doing his podcast The blueprint is pretty sound The problem is  and Ryan is not alone with this narrative  it about getting to 1M in SALES a year  not actual earnings Most businesses operate on thin margins  especially with physical products  So 1M in sales   40k in earnings Of course the real payout is if you can sell the business in 2436 months for real capital You will still need to work about 30004000 hours a year  But most business owners do that anyway The thing I felt Ryan missed was breaking down cost of goods  support services  advertising  marketing  fees and taxes  Would have like more about actual numbers to lend more credibility to the plan  I purchased this version because I like the sound of James Earl Jones  voice  but his pace is much too fast  he sounds rushed  as if he really doesn t want to do it or doesn t enjoy doing it  I hope i can get a refund and try another version  Read it  Heard it  Still love it  Though I would have been more comfortable thinking listening in a feminine voice as much of this story is a woman s perspective  Characters you care about  want to know  Adventure you envy  Dragons you love  Enjoy   I like fiction  I like suspense  I like mystery  Books about business management  sales strategy  and influencing others Not so much But the truth is  I work for a business  I am in sales  and I must honestly and professionally influence others  And because I am part of a recruiting industry  I have to keep up There is a moment at the beginning this book  just a short moment  when a feeling of nostalgia followed by doubt creeps in  A feeling that maybe you have heard these words before  But that feeling doesn t hang around long  It is replaced by a feeling of   Wow  that is what I say    and is followed by   Actually  that s not really what I say  Not quite   It is that  not quite  that separates the winners from the losers Here are 23 things to say when you are needing to influence others  You will learn when to say them  how to say them  and why the human psyche responds to them  There are examples that are pertinent in most any business situation that involves two people who are communicating for the benefit of both parties  Most importantly  it s doable and simple to implement It s a onehour gem  and I m filling in the 5th star  I think I say this after every Joe Pickett novel  but Wow  thats the best yet  How  after all the novels  C J  Box can still create such great story lines based on the same characters just proves how great of an author he is  The only bad part of it is that it had to end  Now the worst part  the year long wait for the next one  I never would have guessed that Richie Valen could write  We all know R C  Bray and Julia Whelan can perform anything  but Lou Diamond Phillips gave them something gorgeous to work with  I would absolutely read another one of these in a heartbeat  More please  I really enjoyed this book and it helped me a lots  A very concise and usable audiobook explaining what you can do to improve relationships  This book helped me understand common sense actions that both partners need to take to help save a relationship  This book presents thoughtful  well researched frameworks  many of which are now commonly accepted approaches to succeeding with disruptive innovation  even for nontech companies  The book was a bit dry though and the case studies could have been briefer  Also  the book discusses charts that help the reader better understand the concepts  I would have preferred to read the book so that I could see the charts  I have always been a fan of this series  but the narrator does not capture the personalities of the characters right  If you have not read the actual books  this might turn you off the series  I listened to  In a Different Key  a few months ago and then I found out about this book In a Different Key looks at the history of Autism through parents and their children with Autism and follows the history of different theories and treatment options  with an in depth look at  refrigerator mothers  and the vaccine controversy  as well as looking at parent advocacy Neurotribes looks more at adults with Autism  touching on important psychologists in Autism s history but also looking at the accomplishments of people with Autism  The correlation between giftedness intelligence and Autism is explored along with advocacy by people with Autism As a parent with two children with Autism and a certified teacher for special education  I found both books to be enlightening   In a Different Key  helped me to see what parents had done before me to get services for their odd children while  Neurotribes  showed me hope for my children s futures So read listen to both in order to get a more complete picture  I have been unhappily fat for a long time  I have read dozens of diet and fitness books  I ve done Primal  Paleo  Keto  Atkins  Weight Watchers  Jenny Craig  and Overeater s Anonymous  I have given up  tried again  cursed myself  gone to counseling  and yoyoed up and down for decades  I recently discovered this bestseller by Michelle Guise on Audible  which introduced me to her world  Everything she wrote makes perfect sense to me  I bought her Rapid Weight Loss book and now this one  It has changed my life and it has not been difficult  They say when the student is ready the teacher appears  I guess I was ready for Michelle Guise  because I can t believe how much better I am  physically and mentally  In one month I dropped a pants size  my skin got tighter  my aches and pains went away  I started sleeping better and my mental health has been so much better  I have lost weight  gained happiness  and finally found the answer  I read this book when it first came out  and I haven t read any book since that terrified me more  It was very intense and I had to have the lights on to listen  Awesome book and awesome narrator  Definitely credit worthy  I absolutely adore this series  The heroine is 45 years old    I love reading about characters that have life experience but can still make a positive change in their life without being down on themselves  This series has everything that I love a hot sexy hero who happens to be middle aged  a spunky best friend  a heroine that I can relate to and magic and mayhem  I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys paranormal  great continuation of the Story  love the author and the narration from Audible  keep it up  I saw this book at my local bookstore the cover caught my eye  But I figured I wouldnt get the chance to read it so I checked to see if it made in to an audiobook  Yay it was I really enjoyed the narrators they brought these characters to life  I loved the way they read the book it made me feel the connection to each character Pepper and Jack are driven high school students who have that snark and I love  Their high school experience is very different from mine  I enjoyed the parallel to Gossip Girl a little it a fun and easy listen I really liked how all the characters fit and gave us a whole picture  It really made the story feel whole I will be looking for more from this author  Absolutely a great trilogy  I loved listening to it from start to finish  lots of suspense and action Great voice acting as well  this will be a treasured series Thank you  This book was a long read  BUT nearly every chapter was full of riveting examples and useful knowledge Im going to reread this again in a few months I enjoyed it that much  I have seen The Godfather movies too many times to count  It s part of the lexicon in my family  we quote lines from it all the time in regular conversation  So  I thought this book might be a little boring  just because I already knew the story so well  Not the case  The book adds so much detail to the story that I think I ll be watching the movie again soon in a whole new light  Joe Mantegna does such a wonderful job narrating this story and I d absolutely recommend his version as opposed to the other full cast version that s out there  especially for people that are really in tune with the movie Give it a try  The writing and reading style is overly cutesy makes me cringe  I can t listen to it any more  The author writes and reads as though the readers listeners are children  For example  the experience of morning sickness is constantly referred to as  a case of the queezies  and  tummy troubles   I m a grown woman and just because I m pregnant does not mean that I ve lost my ability to understand nausea and anatomical terms like stomach Additionally  as a listening experience  the QA sections are hard to navigate  Much of it is not be relevant to each person  It requires constant fast forwarding and you never know what questions are next  The excerpts for male partners are sparse and patronizing  which is hilarious   It is written with the unsympathetic  uninvolved  and clueless stereotype of a male in mind  These also assume there is a male partner or Daddy  Some folks are going at it alone and some folks are not partnered with males  This is one of those special books  a book rejected by dozens of publishers  a book that led its author to suicide  a book that might bring you to tears  of joy  in the end  It is a character study of an almost middle aged man  still living with his mother  who s just about ready to get a job in an elaborately quirky 1970 s New Orleans  told with all the sophistication an overeducated author could muster  It s a really funny piece of fiction that just so happens to be intertwined with real life tragedy There are several different versions of this spoken book  None of them compares to the Barrett Whitener reading  Whitener interprets the sounds of the literal dialects seemingly with ease  And this makes the book a million times more enjoyable to listen to  Audible has taken some time to offer this particular reading on its website  several years in fact  But the quality of this recording makes the wait worth while  Brilliant compilation of history  personal and collective experience  application of theory  and all fused together with wisdom  Excellent clarity  wonderful humility  and thought provoking perspective  How often the  system  responses to  error  events are inappropriate oversimplifications of the complexity of the process involved  The higher the complexity  the greater the necessity for nimbleness of the empowered team members who all share the same vision of the goal  This is a great book  made perfect by the narration of John C Reilly The best narration of an audible book I have ever listened to This book is a stunning example of how power corrupts so completely There is a fine line between sanity and normality I hope Mr Reilly graces us with more narrations in future   Gilead  is one of the most profound  deeply moving novels of our time  Its portrayal of human nature and existence in a universe pervaded by God would perhaps have seemed natural a century and more ago today  it is a revelation  More than once  this novel made me weep  something that no book has ever before done  How fortunate  then  that this blessed novel has been blessed with a great reader  His voice  intonation and pace are ideal for the character of John Ames  the story s ostensible narrator  A perfect reading of a perfect novel what more could one ask of an audible com offering  Scott Trench was able to summarize countless personal finance articles  podcast  and other media for which I have received my own mindset about finance and life as a whole  Where the hell was this book back when I was getting out of college  this book is like a great combination of rich dad poor dad by robert kiosaki and I will teach you to be rich by Ramit Sethi  this book is an absolutely perfect gift for any young professional looking for a manual on adulting done right  or even better than  right   read this book  implement these strategies  and prosper   Nat Geary This is THE BEST book ever  I want another one  Just picture it  Esperanza Rising 2     Just when you thought you had a favorite book this one hits you in the face with a fish  And you re like woah  I love this book   It will make you feel like you are living with them in the setting  I want to go to Mexico and the government camp where they working  No matter what anyone says you should love this book  I ll be in a club with you because you and me love this book so much  READ THE BOOK RIGHT NOW    Buy it  Read it  Love it  Guaranteed  this was written by me a 12 year old P S Get the book now  last time  If you want to read a book that is more about the author than what he is teaching this is the one  If the word  I  were eliminated it would probably be 1 3 in length  Personal anecdotes are great to illustrate points but this felt more like a memoir than book on how to improve the mind  Many will love this book but I could not even finish  Prefer more useable content less stories  Good story but it took a while to figure out the pattern of rewind  fast forward  I liked the readers voice except when she dropped it so quietly to be a whisper of a voice inside a characters head  Turn up the volume to hear the words  then  suddenly her full voice returns painfully loud  Interesting characters and interplay  As an Asian American  the author was like a voice in my head personified  Park Hong brilliantly articulates and elegantly weaves personal history and precise research into a deftly written testament to the Asian American experience  and in turn illuminates the dark corners of what it means to be an American today  It s clear the author is a poet and we get to benefit from that in this audio format   Bravo  After listening to A Thousand Ships by Natalie Haynes I said in my review that we ve really been spoiled for choice when it came to modern reinterpretations of the Greek myths  I think we owe a lot of this newly discovered passion for Greek mythology to Madeline Miller s flawless works Circe and Song Of Achilles  Since her iconic opus was released we ve had feminist interpretations of Briseis  the women of Troy  and even Clytemnestra  We ve gotten LGBTQ interpretations of Achilles and Patroclus  We even got a three book long comedic take on the entire Greek pantheon by the great Stephen Fry  We ve also been fortunate in how consistently great these books have been  Disparate and distinct in their themes and styles but uniformly poignant  wellwritten  and powerful  Madeline Miller  Pat Barker  Colm Tibin  Natalie Haynes  and Stephen Fry have all taken some of the western world s oldest and best known myths and said something fresh and relevant with them Jennifer Saint continues that work and delivers a solid entry with Ariadne  With a good pace  excellent narrator  and compelling main character  the author kept me invested from word one  While it at times reads like a YA Circe  the sympathetic main character and author s deft writing style make it an easy listen and a powerful story  The author is excellent at character work and I d be interested in seeing her interpretation of one of the more classicly  villainous  women of Greek mythology like Medea or Medusa  It ll be exciting to see whatever it is she does next but I sincerely hope she sticks with ancient Greece as she has a great grasp on the culture and meaning of the myths themselves while also making the story relevant to today  If you find you ve enjoyed Ariadne as much as I have and you re looking for something similar in story and quality definitely check out the aforementioned Circe or Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller  A Thousand Ships by Natalie Haynes  The Silence Of The Girls by Pat Barker  or the Mythos series by Stephen Fry  Seldom do you find a book that teaches a history lesson  The great depression and the dust bowl experience in the late 1930 s   and a zoology lesson  Learning about the giraffes   while shedding light on multiple cultural themes  racism  sexism  animal rights  parentchild influence  poverty  etc  woven into such an engaging journey  the narrator is perfect to tell this story  I couldn t wait to get to what was coming next  I highly recommend this for readers if all ages     particular  medical memoir   I ve read A lot of them in the past few years as I grapple with my own stuff  I had no idea that Jaouad had written a younger adults with cancer column for the NYT  I just thought the memoir sounded interesting and the last 20 percent was really good  The rest   just ok  Her writing is adequatepretty straight forward  no lyrical beautiful language to lean on so it really is about the story I think I didn t relate because she seemed so immature and entitledher boyfriend  who s only been her boyfriend for a few months when she gets diagnosed  pretty much has no life at all because all he does is work and then physically and mentally takes care of her  But that s not enough for her  She wants more  more  more  The way she writes it  he couldn t have possibly done anything more  other than to quit his job and take care of her 24 7  so she s not unaware  but she won t allow him to have anything but her  But she can have her burgeoning writing career  which he helps her with  and SPOILER ALERT when they break up  when she s finally semifunctional   within a month  it s onto the next one for her  a childhood friend she eventually marries  I m not sure if she still lacks insight or figured that her brief acknowledgements and epiphanies were enough  But it wasn t for me as a reader  but it might be enough for others Still  I was never bored  and these days that counts for a lot And on the level of  amazing someone can live through that  and come out the other side still wanting to live  get married  have the career she wants even though she ll probably never be entirely well    Well  like I could never do what Will did  I couldn t have done what she did either  Though thinking about it now  that was an unexplored part of the memoir  There s very little about her ever wanting to give up  or it being ok to give up  Again  maybe it was her age  A 22yrold is more likely to want to survive even when there s only a 35 chance of making it to the 5 year cancerfree mark than say  someone my age who has lived a full life and and might not consider the pay off worth 3 years of unimaginable suffering and never being totally well again because of the damage that not only the cancer but the treatment did to her body This was one of the most graphic depictions of cancer that I ve read  She wins the prize for her laconic description of vomiting up the lining of her esophagus  She did her job as a writer on that bit because I don t think I will ever get that out of my head  This book will help anyone struggling with any form of drug addiction  The best book I have ever read on the subject  I had told my teens parts of the story  They won t be trying drugs any time soon  The narration was amazing  He had several characters stored in him with great delivery  The storyline is unique and the plot was strong  I really felt the struggles of generic Asian man  I highly recommend this book and get a copy for yourself  The writing style is scripted which works perfectly for this story  This is the sixth book in the Mistborn  series and third with Wax and his side kick Wayne  It is still set in the early industrial city of Ladrian  three hundred years after the end of the first trilogy  The same magic systems of Allomancy and Feruchemy are still prevalent and through the story we learn more about the forbidden art of Hemalurgy I believe this is a great addition to the Mistborn series  the story flows with more of the action that was prevalent in the first three books  Sanderson fills in some gaps that had been left from the other story lines and I really like the development of Steris and Marasi  We also learn more about the southern lands that had only been briefly mentioned before  I thought this was the end of the double trilogy but Sanderson leaves the door open for more adventures for Wax and Wayne yes please  About the narrator Michael Kramer has always given a fantastic performance  this series would not have the same dynamic impact without him  Five cute romantic stories with interesting and entertaining characters and storylines  Enjoyable and smiling inducing character banter provided hours of entertainment and a break from real life  The narrator did a fantastic job with providing unique voices for each character and appropriate tone inflections for each scene for the stories  I received a free copy of this audiobook at my request and have voluntarily left this review  I am book book kind of girl  I love the feel of a heavy book in my hands and the way it feels tossed in my bag going with me wherever I go But when Mike Rowe writes and narrates his own book  I turn into an audio book girl really quickly My kids and I have have a long commute to their school every day  Turns out my kids love listening to Mike just as much as I do Also easily able to FF chapters like 4    Funny for me but the 6 year old would have all kinds of questions I do not want to answer yet    I read a lot and listen to a lot of audiobooks  from classic literature to contemporary biographies  philosophy  psychology and the latest in nonfiction  Seldom do I find a book that surprises me  This one did  Though very familiar with the thoughts of Freud and Jung  I had never heard of their colleague Alfred Adler until I came across this book  interestingly enough through the recommendation of a guy I dont like  The thoughts of Dr  Adler opened new possibilities and pointed to solutions of problems I have been grappling with for years  His original way of thinking and his method truly can change ones life  Even though the questioning young man in the audio version irritated me at times  maybe it was supposed to  the content is so good that I could not turn away  If you are interested in personal growth and how to better navigate the journey of life  allow yourself to get immersed in Adlerian thought through the voice of the philosopher  Chances are  it will change your life as it did mine  I don t usually write huge reviews but compelled to tell someone how I feel about this book  Many people are down on Demi for sharing her truth  claiming it is only out of her misery or jealousy but I have to disagree    also  how many autobiographies are out there     Demi  You may be a successful sober millionaire actress who has accomplished more than I could ever have but I relate to you  on SO many Levels           Thank you for sharing this inspiring story    It has really shed light on my own mother and our relationship and the many issues I have had in my own life  I have cried  smiled and felt a deep sense of connection through your words  I loved the book  Would have loved for it to last longer  Brutally violent  Blood Meridian turns the 19th century American West into a kind of hellish but hauntingly beautiful dreamscape  through which a gang of mercenaries wanders  killing without aim or reason  There is no comfort to be found anywhere in this novel  which overturns all Old West Myths  leaving only a stark  maddening world in which man exists on the edge of nihilism   civilization  an illusion  The characters are almost opaque  reduced to actions in minimal dialogue  Even the language seems intended to confound and discomfit the reader  mixing arcane  halfforgotten scientific and philosophical terms with passages that sound almost like something from the Bible Yet  McCarthy is the definition of a powerful writer  His prose is hypnotic  the book s scenes affecting the reader as much by their eerie beauty and lyricism as by the horror and violence contained within  Their images will stick around in your head for days  The Judge  a monstrous  demihuman prodigy at the center of novel  whose amused  philosophical queries about whether or not the scenes around him represent man in man s natural state  is one of the more memorable characters I ve come across in fiction Make no mistake  Blood Meridian is filled with powerful questions  about morality  about evil  about humanity s need for violence and dominance  about the nature of God  and so forth  Sometimes these questions are expressed explicitly  usually by the Judge  but mostly  they swirl just beneath the surface of the nightmare  challenging the reader to peer into the abyss and examine them  Though we don t live in such lawless times anymore  the distance from our safe doorsteps to the modern equivalent of a gang of roving  murderous scalpers may be shorter than we think McCarthy will certainly never be an author to everyone s taste  and not with this work  but Blood Meridian has made a few critics   Best of the 20th Century  lists for a good reason  This is a firstrate work of modern literature  Saunders has a knack for oration and it feels like he s holding class in your head  A true privilege to be his pupil as he raises Chekhov s gun and shows us what all the bullets are for  As a teacher of lit myself I have picked up a ton of analysis and new understanding  The art of short story becomes nothing less than mankind s best religion through this type of exploration  Saunders nails a Gladwellian approach that feels like a hybrid textbook  podcast  and motivational self help book    With wonderfully performed stories narrated by pros  The whole experience is creatively edited  My best audiobook experience in ages  I went from speaking a few words to being able to hold a conversation  This Spanish Course is simply Amazing    The Lessons are fun  effective  and never get old  This author gets two thumbs up Perfect for beginners  I brought one for a friend to listen at the same time  We got so much out of this audiobook  and it was super easy to understand  I refer back to this audiobook and use it as a guide  resource  I am at the super early beginning stages of planning for my business  and this book really helped turn my creative wheels  I really love how it s organized  Definitely geared for a beginningmiddleend plan  I value the  example  boxes that offer genuine situations  I realize the audiobook stresses practice  however with restricted practice  I as of now feel like I have taken in a ton  Also  one more thing  I like this audio book because I learned a lot  Everybody wants to know how to analyze people because of its techniques and methods  Really enjoyed this one  Story held my attention throughout and the duet narration was awesome  Looking forward to the next book  This is my first book by this Author after hearing glowing reviews from other harem fans and let me tell you  it is no surprise I would love it What did surprise me was the fantastic mystery thrown into this Apocalypse that will keep you guessing all the way up until the end As far as the Chill in this apocalypse  Oh man  I was not disappointed  The sex scenes are hot as Fuck and delightfully graphic  Make sure you are alone when you listen to ch17  you will thank me Last but not least I want to heap oodles of praise on Sierra Kline  her cotton candy voice is such a pleasure to listen to and she does such a good job with the male voices I sometimes forgot it wasn t dual narration  Her performance during the  Chill  part made my toes curl in happiness  Such a wonderful narrator  give this girl aaaaall the work  3So if you are looking for a hot harem audiobook with a damn interesting story and a voice like liquid candy don t hesitate to buy this  Well worth my money  It helps me to not only learn the words  but also to pronounce them  Personally  I enjoy the the testing section because it helps me memorize what I have learned in past lessons  I would recommend this audiobook to anyone who desires to have a good experience learning the Italian language while enjoying himself  I wasnt expecting much when I selected this book but was pleasantly surprised and couldnt stop listening I liked all three narrators who really made it seem that they were telling a story that they had experienced  I have a lot of meditation books but don t have one in Spanish  I found this book at the perfect time since I m learning how to speak Spanish  Overall I found the techniques helpful  The language was a bit of a barrier at times  but that s all part of the learning process  If you want a practical book on meditation in Spanish or simply want an additional resource to learn the language  then look no further  Highly recommended  This book literally helped me understand my human fully  Emotional intelligence is way more important than any other intelligence in my opinion so having the opportunity to fully understand  develop myself in this way is amazing  Stephen frys reading is much better than this one  Jim dale uses the same voice for tons of characters and does a poor job of capturing appropriate tones in the dialog given the situation or descriptive text that j k  Rowling used describing the line s  I originally gave this book a pretty rough review  As the weeks have gone by I kept thinking I should go back and give it another shot There it was  just sitting in my library  beckoning   I so enjoyed The Hunting Party that I just HAD to try this one again and I am so glad that I did  As the book progresses it got a lot spookier  the tension grows  the atmosphere builds  it was wonderful Once I got over my initial issues with it  somewhat shallow stereotypes  a lot of characters to keep up with  and annoying male frat boy antics  I fell in love with this creepy  claustrophobic story  Definitely worth a listen and a credit  I am very glad that I gave it another chance  The ending was brilliant  it was a total surprise and completely fleshed out  I so appreciate it when an ending is as thorough and well thought out as the rest of the book  This is somewhat rare in the mystery genre  Also the narration was phenomenal  I especially love love loved Hannah and Aoife All of the performances were excellent  I related to Olivia  I especially liked the way that initially she seems quite shallow and lost but as things progress  her perspective becomes more relatable and more reliable  The Hunting Party is truly one of my all time favorite books  like literally top 3 of all time and this one is equally entertaining  Give it a shot and be patient  dont be put off by how annoying some of these characters are in the beginning  As the plot progresses they become much more sympathetic  real  and interesting As they become more exposed they become more human Dont give up too quickly  give it a chance to get good  So the levels of the power doesn t really matter as you can see even a first year student can hold off experienced higher level opponents with some prepping  Let s just make up stuff while we go  shall we  And the LGBT bit was dropped in like a bomb without preamble  It is got a good world setup but all gone to waste  I cant decide if the book was good or not  I hated the narrators voice  So obnoxious  I need to remember to listen to a sample before buying the book  Stumbled upon this  jumped right in because I really like this author  loved the first book  Please tell me therell be more  The narrator is now one of my all time favorites as well  Thank you Audible for CLEAN well written books  Stephen King is one of the best authors in the world  He has written more than 100 books  short stories  and novellas in almost all genres out there  I experienced many of them as audiobooks and his latest novel  Later  was released yesterday  for the excitement of millions of his fans around the world The king of horror  thrillers and suspense  the bestselling and award winning author Stephen King  delivers another amazing story featuring a young boy who can see communicate with people just after they die  and his life gets stranger with every year as he grows older  Combining in his unique  flowing and mesmerizing writing style mystery with thriller and adding a touch of horror  this celebrated author continues to shock and delight his fans Renowned actor Seth Numrich does a fantastic job with the narration for Later  He perfectly captures the emotions and drama that our young hero is living  Switching seamlessly between characters  assigning each of them different voices  accents and personalities  he grabs the listener by the throat from the first disjointed phrase and doesn t let go until the very end This was the first time for me listening to him  and his first time performing a Stephen King book  but in my humble opinion  he acquitted himself exemplary Later is pure Stephen King  original  gripping  entertaining  scary and so captivating  I needed a change in life  ImNot so optimistic never have been  I once was an amazing mom but 4 kids later and I let the little things consume me and the joy be removed  I let the thoughts and cares of the world change who I was This book reset me  I am and will reread this book several times  If I wasnt a nursing student I would listen to it once a month  The audio being read by the author makes it authentic and keeps you listening If you are struggling to find a balance in life  looking for peace  or to reset  YOU NEED THIS BOOK  This book  as normal  was excellently written and narrated  every character is interesting  my only complaint is that Thrawn  whom the book is named after  only takes a supporting role throughout most of the book  He is there for much of the action  yet we never see his thoughts or perspective  making this book much note about the Chiss Ascendancy than Thrawn himself  Which is not bad  just be aware of that and temper your expectations  A very interesting story but spends too much time on the romance and sex than the actual storyline with long stretches between the interesting action parts Loved it  This book leaves me with that rare feeling that I don t know what to read next  Actually  the even rarer condition that I need a break from reading so I can continue to savor this book a little longer  I don t think I can review it properly  However  it s a story intricately wound and wonderfully wicked  I loved getting to know each of the characters  even though Kaz is the star  you learn to appreciate all six of the gang  The settings and fantasy elements were great  sometimes helter skelter and at other times melodic  The ending  That was perfect  It s worthy of recommendation PS  Agree with others that Wylan s narrator was terrible for the part  and still this didnt affect my enjoyment of the book  Although hailed as being on par with Jack Reacher andJason Bourne the protagonist  Matthew Ryker  in this new series has more in common with Jack Winchester  This book is fast and fun and full of action  There are places in the story that require a suspension of disbelief The outstanding narration by Jay Snyder completes the book making it a great rather than just a good listen HIGHLY RECOMMENDED If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank You  I listen to so many books and rarely ever take the time to write a review  This book get me interested the entire time  Without giving any spoils it was actually very touching and had me teary eyed  I did not see the ending coming at all  You may think its predictable at times but it might not be as predictable as it seems  The narrator also did an amazing job  I highly recommend   I was torn between giving this 3 or 4 stars  On the one hand  this book is an incredible work of imagination by one of the greatest authors of all time  This book provides a lot of history and context to the LOTR story  On the other hand  this book is not a single unified story such as the LOTR or the Hobbit  Rather  it is a collection of appendices that aren t really very interesting unless you are a diehard Tolkien fan  And even then  this book takes a lot of effort and concentration to get through  In the end I gave it three stars because I think that is the most fair to let other readers know what to expect here  I should have read other reviews more carefully before reading this and I would have known more what to expect  I was expecting this to be a story set in an earlier time in the LOTR universe  but that is not what The Silmarillion is  I think that a better  more accurate  but probably much more mundane  title would have been  The Prequel Appendices to the LOTR   because that is exactly what this book is  Some of the chapters are easier to read than others  My favorite part was at the very end with the postIsildur material and the short historical context of the LOTR saga  Understand that the chapters read a lot like a combination of a King James version of Genesis 1 and 2 and an encyclopedia article  The accounts are always overviews of events  and even in the tales that contain some more detailed action  you still get a very distant view of things  Overall  my advice would be to NOT read The Silmarillion like a regular book  That s not what it is  Instead  treat it like background material  and read like I would read the World Book Encyclopedia when I was a kid  just crack it open now and again and read an article at a time  As a long time fan on Harlan Coben I was overjoyed to see he he came out with this new book  I think Ive either read or listened to every book hes written with the exception of his famous Bolitar series  Im not sure why    There are many references to Myron Bolitar in this book  yet Coben does an excellent job providing background that I didnt feel lost  I think I will have to get that series The publishers summary is quite accurate and gives a great overview of this story so I will not go into details about the book  The only thing I would end up doing is spoiling this for the next reader About the protagonist  Win  This is an intriguing character  He is so full of himself and his ease with the old money he grew up with  Yet hes very likable and in some ways very much a person as opposed to a personality  Hes fleshed out and believable The mystery is very good and there are so many outcomes that I was unable to predict the correct one  which totally floored me Steven Webers narration is flawless This book has my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank You  Easy to listen to  few characters  but the storyline  as a mystery  was pretty easy to predict  The narrator did a fantastic job bringing this book to life  I ve read a couple books by this author and I must say  I really enjoyed this particular novel  There are a couple sentimental and tearful scenes  of course  I thought that the complicated relationship between the sisters was very realistic mainly due to the fact that no relationship is ever perfect  My favorite character throughout the book was Meghan  She is such a strong independent female character  Her view towards men after her divorce was quite harsh  especially after I learned that it was basically her fault the relationship ended in the first place What made this novel unique is that it mostly revolved around the relationship of these two sisters  who were born from the same mother  by different fathers  and both ending up living different lives and facing different struggles  Thank you  I am emotional about how easily grownups can try to diminish children and those who look a bit different or speak without being understood  The story was written in a way that held me with emotion and thought  Thank you for selecting an excellent narrator  Another great book  You MUST read both of her other series before this  You really need the back story to know who these people are and whats going on  Don t think that is super clear since its listed as a new series Loved this book  love everything she writes   Alot of back story to help fill the holes  and understand characters better  Great plot  seemed a bit slow at times but worth the wait Goes through the different characters dealing with their own issues and really leaves you hanging in the end  Going to be really hard to wait for the next book  Great narrator as always   I d give 10 stars if I could  Julia Whelan is on point  as usual  and the story flows effortlessly  So much love for the Catskill s  Kellerman s Resort is still inspirational after all this time   This family s love  honor  and tradition radiates through Julia Whelans portrayal of the characters  This author is new to me but this book has made me a fan  Smile on my face  laughing out loud  and tears in my eyes kind of book  I didn t want to stop listening  Oh how I wish this was a Series and there was a continuation of this beautiful story  God I love Grampa Amos and Grama Fanny  Amos  Fanny  Bernie  Louise  Amy  Brian  Peter  Greta  Maddie  Zach  Michael and Phoebe I will miss you all   Buy this book  you will be so glad you did  Steven Weber s narration of  It  was fantastic  That narration coupled with the writing of Stephen King made this one of the most enjoyable audibooks I ve heard Just a note on the editingThis book is written following the adult versions of the characters in this novel  The adults then recall events that happened during their childhood  The reason King chose to end a chapter  and seemingly begin the next chapter midsentence  is to show that the adult character is having a flashback to their childhood  Once you realize what King is doing  the seemingly poor ceases to be an issue  I am writing this after having finished the entire trilogy  While this was an incredible book and stands alone just fine on its own  I wanted to reserve judgement on each book till I finished the trilogy in order to put each one into perspective  This was my first Bandon Sanderson book and I loved it  At first  it was challenging to get into the whole concept of Allomancy but I eventually did and appreciated every aspect of this masterpiece  The books moved quickly  the story is rich in its treatments of many aspects personal character  politics  government  philosophy and religion  And each character is fully developed to the point where we probably care about all of them including some of the bad ones  The world created by Brandon Sanderson and stunningly narrated by Michael Kramer is not like any one I or probably any of us could have possibly imagined  As long as this trilogy was  I am so sorry to have it finally end  This book is AMAZING  The PDFs are very helpful  For folks having trouble finding them take a look at the title review  upper right drop down menu on my phone app  the website is listed at the end of the summary  Www drjoedispenza com bsn Okay    In all fairness  Ive gotta admit that the first three BOBiverse books easily rank among my all time favorite audible books  I have listen to the complete series at least half a dozen times  I will also admit that I downloaded Heavens River the moment it became available and immediately put in a marathon listening session  So  with that said    NOT disappointed  At first I was skeptical on how to meaningfully continue the series  especially when the synopsis makes it feel like nothing more than a needless Quest for Bender follow up   I couldnt have been any further off the mark  Even though the first section of the story primarily revolves around Bobprime  the audience is quickly propelled into the realization that Bobs distant clones arent just petulant children  but may indeed have their own legitimate point of view  As the listener  you really do begin to question who is right    and just because youre familiar with a character doesnt mean it is who you would naturally align with in the real  The story provides some very timely commentary on the validity of a dissenting ideologically in a fractured society  I will admit  at times I did feel the actual quest to find rescue Bender was a bit of needlessly protracted time filler  but Ray Porters superb narration skills keeps the extended storyline tolerable  Ultimately  If you loved the earlier entries into the BOBiverse  then you will have no problem picking up with the rest of the moot and enjoying the ride  If one thing has been made clear to me with this book  it is that the BOBiverse has the potential for a series of never ending stories  Long live  I mean clone  Bob  I became invested in The Witcher after watching the netflix show and wanted more  i knew about the game  but had no idea there was a book series until a post online told me not only that it existed  but the order itself  So here s me  a thirsty mfer wanting more Geralt content and diving head first into this series  I loved this book  Not that Im antizombie or road warrior style post apocalypse stories  But its unbelievably refreshing to read  listen to  a story about good people working their way through a terrible situation  In fact  Im going to listen to it again right now  And you cant stop me    Let me preface my review by saying that you should take my review with a grain of salt  This book came highly recommended to me and seems to be pretty well liked overall  Currently  on goodreads  there are over 318 000 ratings and the book has a 4 star average A Discovery of Witches is book one of the All Souls Trilogy  This is the first book that I have tried from this author  I m not sure if I would try another I love fantasy  witches  vamps  demons  all that  I thought A Discovery of Witches would be right up my alley and had been really excited to read it for a while  Unfortunately  I found it to be boring and it just droned on  I couldn t connect with the main character at all and had no interest in her or what she was saying because it was just monotonous  As I mentioned a moment ago  there are witches and vampires and demons and up to the point where I stopped reading  there wasn t any air of excitement at all  The main character is a scholar who spends every day  all day  in the Oxford library researching old books and manuscripts and talks about it ad nauseam  She is also a witch but refuses to acknowledge her powers and makes an effort to do everything the long and tedious way to prove that she doesn t need magic to succeed  Except for when she does use magic and rationalizes it away  When she isn t in the library she is running or rowing a boat  Couple all of that with some flowery prose and that was the beginning of the book in a nutshell  The audiobook is 24 hours long  I only made it 2 5 hours so maybe it gets better   I mean it has to  right  I just couldn t take anymore to find out for myself The narration was fine  I didn t have any problems with it  It seemed pretty monotone but honestly  I think that was just how the book was  not anything the narrator did  I was very curious about how this book was going to be since I love Lauren s work and this is Joe s first time writing  I gotta say I wasn t sure at first but as the book and the characters started to come to life I absolutely started to get the Lauren Blakely vibe but also I could feel the difference from her other books which is obviously where Joe comes in  In the beginning it felt light and fun but then it went into a little deep direction and sexy too  I didn t realize at first just how much Teddy s past was holding him back and had affected his future but really enjoyed seeing him overcome and move forward even with his fears still present  London was a great female lead  she was very forward and I loved that  I especially enjoyed the side characters in this book  from London s girlfriends who were so funny but also super supportive to her brother who was even more supportive  I loved the HEA and I all the epilogues  these authors didn t leave up wondering about anything I also have to say I seriously loved the extra s in this audiobook  The Q  A with Joe  Lauren was very eye opening and really felt very honest and the bloopers were hilarious      Listening to all the girls laughing had me cracking up Now let s talk about Joe s narration    I will be honest here and say before this book I have enjoyed Joe s narration but this book really was a huge leap in my opinion for his narration  I don t know if it was because he knew the story so well already or if he was just so proud of this book but it seriously showed in his narration  I think he shined in this book more than I have ever heard him before  He captured all the emotions  banter and fun perfectly  Great job  Was this written by the REAL Stephen King   It dragged on forever and I only stuck with it to see if it would get better  It didnt  No disrespect  Mr King  I am a huge fan  but I will be returning this one Don t feel like writing a long review just will say this  The stories are all excellent  the writing true to Arthur Conan Doyle s style and the language of the day  and Holmes and Watson are excellently characterized  If I didn t know better  I d swear Conan Doyle penned them himself I can offer no higher praise as a Holmes fan then that  This was my most anticipated book of 2020 and it s no surprise that this is now my favorite Lauren Blakely book to date  I love Stone  Jackson  they are so different but their chemistry and attraction for each other was palpable  Not only could I feel the love but man these two were HOT  The sex scenes were plenty and that is what I expected because of the build up of sexual tension between these two in other books by this author  The ending of this book had my heart soaring because I love LOVE and I love HEA even more and their HEA was perfect  I am a huge fan of MM Romance and I especially love that Lauren writes true MM Romance  no GFY or hiding  no shame  just a love story between to people I will admit that I loved this book so much that I listened to it twice back to bcak because It left me with such a happy heart Now I NEED to talk about the narration  Anyone who s ever listened to Teddy and Jacob know that they are amazing and together they steal the show  I was just finishing another MM Series with these two when I received One Time Only so I was a little concerned I would struggle to transition them into the new characters  Boy I was SO wrong  In Chapter 1 they were Jackson and Stone  Jacob embodied Stone  he really brought out Stone s personality  his playfulness and even his insecurities  Teddy is my favorite male narrator and his performance in this book reminds me why  To me he is the perfect nice guy next door but when he became Jackson he showed off just how great an actor he is  Jackson is intense and quiet but also passionate and dominating and Teddy became all of those things  gone was the normal nice guy and the transformation was incredible As usual with Lauren Blakely s audiobooks she adds some fun extras  This one has a Stella Hunter interview with Teddy and Jacob which was so fun and also a little teaser of the next MM Lauren Blakely book Scoring With Him also narrated by Teddy and Jacob  I m already counting down the days  Fry is my favorite  This is yet another albeit one of his best examples of writing  acting  research  creativity and overall entertaining  He blends beautifully legend  myth  history  fact  fiction and pure imaginative genius so well even I a simpleton can enjoy the creation  learn from it and mostly sit in awe of all I don t know  didn t know and don t understand but now at least have a grasp of and all the while loving the journey as Fry s amazing voices play it all out in my head  Thank you Mr  Fry  Thank you very much  As a man who first listened to Come as You Are  and who then recommended it to his wife and 15 yearold son  I was excited to move on to Burnout  As many did  I found the stress response cycle to be an intriguing idea in Come as You Are  I also found the book to be more universally applicable to men and women than the title suggested  gaining valuable insights into my own sexuality  not just my partner s My lone exception to Burnout book is the introduction  The introduction lumps all men into The Patriarchy and then proceeds to label The Patriarchy as The Enemy  I kept waiting for some distinction to emerge between The Enemy and men who care about their wives and daughters and the cultural messages they receive about their lives and particularly how they SHOULD lead their lives  Yet no mention was ever made in fact The Enemy  without distinction  was repeated multiple times throughout the introduction As a college educated  white male and the sole income earner in a 1950 sstyle nuclear family  I understand the privileged position I m in  And I don t take it for granted  Yet that privilege doesn t impart a carefree  stressfree life  My gender and my role carry their own embedded and misguided cultural messages  their own stressors  and I do actually have my own stressresponse cycle to complete  But above all else  I care about how my wife and young daughter are expected to move through and respond to the world I kept waiting for the introduction to make the leap to the conceptual Enemy  The Should  I can except The Patriarchy as having established and continuing to perpetuate the myth of Should  It is the idea that any of us Should live our lives conforming to outdated and detrimental cultural norms about gender  religious  and racial equality  and more importantly true  individual freedoms  that is The Enemy  Failing to make room for a single man who actually cares is itself a perpetuation of outdated and detrimental cultural stereotypes It hasn t ruined the book for me  The book is  as expected  insightful  helpful and universally applicable to women and to men  who also actually have emotions   I ll still ask that my wife listen to it  and even recommend it to both my 15yo son and 12yo daughter  And I d recommend it to whomever has taken the time to read this  Odd Thomas was a thoroughly enjoyable and engrossing book  Never realized Dean Koontz had such a great sense of humor  Listened to every word while driving across the desert  Reader David Aaron Baker was fantastic  He became Odd Thomas  and as I totally suspended my disbelief  Odd Thomas became real Denise Kusel The first book in this series   Extreme Leadership  is a must read and if you have not read it  you should  This followup is an expansion and more indepth exploration of a obvious  but apparently ignored by some readers  concept that all forms and aspects of leadership must be balanced  Every good idea can be taken too far  The dichotomy of leadership and maintaining balance in shifting circumstances  within a group and with individuals  is why leadership is not as easy as simply maximizing a few principals Understanding that is important and the examples used in the book are relatable to anyone who has served in combat  but largely  a whole book on this principle is not as desperately called for as are the overall principles from Extreme Leadership  which actually already encompasses the ideas expressed again in this book  in more detail  Bottom line is that it was a good book and worth the time to read it  but it a bit of icing on the cake of the first book and offers some refinement  but nothing earth shattering that you should not already know  Of course  knowing and putting these things into practice are not the same thing  The devil is in the execution and the book does do a fairly good job of showing real life examples as a guide beyond textbook perfection  I love the Thrawn books and Marc Thompson is a brilliant voice actor  but overuse of totally unnecessary audio effects make it difficult to listen to this audiobook  The distortion effect used during the dialogue in Chapter 1 is so heavy  I had to go back and listen to it again  twice  because I found it hard to understand the character dialogue  Not the kind of experience listeners enjoy  and if Thrawn wasnt in my top five favorite Star Wars characters  I would have given up and returned the book Hey producers guess what  Marc Thompson is super talented  Why not let his voice do the work  yes  For those like me  who loved The Six of Crows duology but only liked Shadow and Bone as it moved away from Alinas story and  towards  well  anyone else  this conclusion to King of Scars is fantastic  While theres still not enough of Kazs crew  theres at least more than before  and a small heist for old times sake  Also  finally the action  steam punk  and twists are on full display  Finally Were there some off points  Perhaps  Not sure I buy the way things ended with the Darkling  And it does feel like most of the characters endings were written to please the fans  rather than to provide a plausible endings to all three series in the we always get the short end of the stick Grishaverse  But  on the whole  I was a little wrecked  somewhat surprised and ultimately well satisfied with this ending  I ve been listening to Audible books since 2015  and this is one of the most phenomenal books I ve read Here s a short review Don t wonder if you should get the book  Get the book  amazing book to become a better person and consequently a better parent  theory  why  and practical advises  how nice voice and narrator  which is the writer her self  should be thought in schools and universities  Absolutely incredible  KTF in the house  And RC just kills it as only he can  This was on so many  best  lists  I can t recall a book that I have had to stay up all night with as I did with this one  It is a mind bending adventure that makes you ask  What would I do in the same situation    Excellent and believable  I am so glad it was recommend to me  I LOVED this book  I did not want the story to end  I wanted more of the story between the end of then and the end of now    My heart hurts for the Lost Friends   as my heart always hurts when I read of these injustices done to any person or animal  I am so thankful for others like me who believe that God created us all equally and one should not be treated as less for any reason  Thank you Lisa Wingate for bringing the Lost Friends to life for me  Fritz Klenner was batsh t crazy  His 1st cousin Susie Newsom was right behind him  Together they were a paranoid force that singlehandedly snuffed out 3 generations of their OWN family The Newsom  Lynch and Sharp families are dissected down to their cores in this book and I feel I know their familial flowcharts better than they do  thanks to this book  Esteem  prominence and prosperity couldn t save any of them from this depravity  I don t want to spoil the contents of this MAGNIFICENTLY put together  complete  book  so    I won t If you ever had a slight interest in True Crime  this book is on your bucket list  Jerry Bedsoe clearly poured every ounce of his heart into investigating and retelling this roller coaster of a story  I used to live in the area where this  situation  occurred and was extremely appreciative of the author s details  down to street names  I could see where they were  when they were  and that added a extra level of hitoverthehead reality for me Be prepared for a lenghty  detailfilled journey  If you re into knowing it all  you re going to love this Extremely well done  Don t hesitate PS  Kevin Stillwell the PERFECT voice for this book PSS  Tom Lynch  you have my deepest sympathies  Kendall Greer and Drew Merritt have a lovehate relationship   she hates him and he secretly loves her  They can t avoid each other because their respective best friends are married to each other  Kendall hates Drew the player  who calls her dumb pet names   KK  Ken doll to name a few  But what if Drew was no longer a player and was really interested in Kendall   dare she take the chance  No  Nuhuh  No way  Except   that Thanksgiving weekend where they get snowed in together in a cabin on Mt  Hood  Has Drew really changed  Kendall thought so then she s proven wrong   or has she  Throw in a surprise pregnancy and now Kendall and Drew are totally linked together for life  Will this pair be able to get past miscommunications and social media bombs and have a happily ever after  Buckle up and get ready because this book will take you on a wild ride  I wish I could take back the review I did on book 1 of this series  I said it was chick lit  which it is  too some degree  but to pass this series by because of a few sex scenes from the ladies point of view is foolish in balance with the really great story that you would miss I was drawn to the first book because it dealt with time travel and was rated 5 stars  I got the second book because I became very attached to the characters and it also was rated 5 stars  The author is a very good writer and the narration is freakishly perfect  I prefer male narration because female narrators rarely narrate the male parts well enough  but Davina Porter pulls it off quite well So far I ve listened to her for about 70 hrs and I feel I could go on listening to her indefinatly   Perfectly nuanced  perfectly timed   wonderfully relaxing  and sumptuously toned  thats how I would describe her narration Im very happy that I have something like 5 big books left to go in this series  yet I already feel some separation anxiety of loosing these characters  thats testament to the fine writing Dianna Gabaldon has produced  Do not read while pregnant or menstrating  you will cry hard ugly tears This is a good book  maybe a great book  But you really need to be in the mood for some heavy angst here and honestly one of the reasons that I read JQ is for something fairly lighthearted  funny  and low angst First of all  I have a very hard time with the idea of loving someone and then going and sleeping with a different person or many people as some sort of surrogate  That gives me a huge ick factor and I have a hard time trusting that person  a  actually IS in love or  b  can be faithful to said love  I know  Im going to get shit for that  but thats how I feel especially when it comes to romance novels  I detest other woman and other man drama  sleeping around after meeting the heroine hero  etc  and love triangles  And each one of those things is in this book    and yet  its really a very good book  But its just too sad  Michaels unrequited love is too sad Francesca losing her husband  too sad Francesca losing her baby  too sad Francesca losing Michael to India  too sad Michael and Francescas guilt  too sad Michaels sleeping around when  a  he loves Francesca and  b  even when she becomes available    too flipping sad Alls well that ends well but while this book is perfect for those looking for an angsty borderline depressing book  or just need a good cry jag  look no further  I love this entire series but this book might just be my favorite  I dont know what to do with myself now that Ive read them all  This is a really really good book  I know I certainly enjoyed it and think anyone who appreciates a good court room drama will have a great time listening to this one The protagonist  Matt Taylor  is hired by a family whose son was in a car accident  He was misdiagnosed at a hospital and further injured after he was admitted  Represented by a busy ambulance chasing attorney  the attorney handed the case to a first year lawyer  Medical issues were missed and the statute of limitations expired  Taylor then sues the hot shot ambulance chaser for legal negligence on behalf of a young man who is now a quadriplegic  After two attempts on his life  Matt Taylor knows hes got a good case if he can live through it Both the plot and characters are well developed and believable  Being the parent of of two adult physically disabled daughters I can say his description of care requirements for people with physical limitations is quite accurate  This is a fast paced legal thriller that leaves you thinking about it long after youve finished the book Roger Wayne does an outstanding job narrating HIGHLY RECOMMEND If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank You  I enjoyed reading this book about five women pioneers of aviation  They are as follows Louise McPhetridge Thaden  19051979  first female to win the Bendix Trophy  Ruth Rowland Nichols  19011960  held simultaneous world records for speed  altitude and distance  Ruth Elder  19021977  was an actress  Elder held many speed and distance records  Florence Klingensmith  19041933  was the first women to have a pilots license in North Dakota  She did lots of racing derbies and set speed records  Amelia Earhart  18971937  Earhart is the most well known of the early aviators  She was first women to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean and the first women to fly from Oakland to Hawaii in 1935  She set many records in her career  All these women were founding members of the NinetyNines  an international organization of women pilots formed in 1929 by ninetynine women  Earhart was the first president I have met a number of these early women aviators and have an interest in flying  I was taught to fly a piper cub by Pancho Barnes  19011975  in Muroc  CA in the late 1940s  Pancho was also a founding member of the Ninetynines  Pancho started setting records in the 1920s  I have read a few stories about these women  but  unfortunately  there is not much available  I am so glad that Keith OBrien wrote this book about these five pioneers of aviation  OBrien created lots of suspense about flying  but I wished he had been able to bring these women to life more vividly  The book is packed with information about the early days of flying and the records these women broke The book is just over twelve hours  Erin Bennett does a good job narrating the book  Bennett is an actress  voice over artist and awardwinning audiobook narrator  Bennett has won multiple Earphone Awards  Rachel Hollis is ugh  Don t waste your money or your time  Try literally any other selfhelp book  I especially enjoy genuine  caring and supportive folks like Glennon Doyle  This audiobook of 27 hours    reads like a genealogy of kings  There is very little character development or story telling  It is extremely tedious at its worst and barely entertaining at its best  Im truly shocked at how many people have fivestarred this title  On a positive note  the narration performance is amazing and I am certain I would not have finished the book had it been narrated by a less talented reader  Caveat Emptor for sure  I listen to a lot of military Special Forces memoirs and non fiction  and I have been looking for another book to grab my attention  This book totally did exactly that  I always love it when the authors of these kind of books do their own narration  The life they breathe into their own story by reading it with the raw emotion and passion someone should have about the struggles and triumphs they have experienced can be felt through the words spoken by this author  The unlikely path from basically Nigerian royalty to the streets of the Bronx  where hustle and street smarts were the only path for most  This young man was given a chance to change his purpose in life by a caring and passionate Naval recruiter  that lead him to Buds and eventually the coveted Navy Seal Trident  The struggles he faced emotionally  physically  and spiritually give a glimpse into mind and soul of the true Warrior spirit  This audio book was a welcome addition to my collection and was just what I was looking for after listening to You cant hurt me by David Goggins  Its an amazing journey that I quickly finished hoping for more  I hope others enjoy it as much as I did  This is a spin off from the Chronicles of Elantra series  but you dont need to read that series to follow and enjoy this book  This book is part of the back story for Severn  one of my favorite characters from the Cast books  It tells us how he came to be a Wolf how he met the Thaalani Cast Lord Ybelline  the Keeper Evanton  and the Eternal Emperor and his introduction to the High Halls The characters were engaging and the plot was interesting  The pace was well done  It was definitely worth the credit and Ill probably listen to the book again every time a new book comes out in the series  I cant wait for the next book which is supposed to be Severns journey to the West March Kristine Hvam  who also narrates the Cast novels  did a great job and the voices of the characters were consistent with their voices in the Cast novels which I really appreciate  The only criticism I have is that the pronunciation for Ellieann was different in this book than in the Cast novels  Probably not a big deal to most  but did make me cringe the first time I heard it  I liked the diversity of her voices for the characters which makes it easy to keep track of who is talking  The tone she gives the book is exactly what I imagine the author intended  I honestly have never wanted to read this book nor purchase any version  I do have the screenplay because I mean the cover is beautiful  But besides that  it does not call my attention fully However  I saw that Audible published this title a few months ago and I heard the preview    and oh my god  This is just one of the best narrations and productions I have heard in my life  There is nothing better than read  but when you listen a book that is full of special effects and sounds of dragons  pixies  fairies  merpeople  and other fantastic beasts that you can come up with    it is just another story and another world For more about this or other reviews  Check out my profile  Inkish Kingdoms  OMG    Thank God for Audibles return policy  otherwise buying this would be a true waste of money  This is nothing more than a very  smooth pitched  mind fuck to try to get a listener to give his company more cash flow for financial education  Smooth con  Took me about 34 hours of listening to figure it out  If you are looking for TRUE wisdom  I recommend a book called The simple path to wealth by JL Collins  I have read all of Chuck s books  this is my favorite one since doomed  seems more like a classic chuck than some of the more recent stuff This book was GREAT   My 2nd book from Lisa Jewell  first being Then She Was Gone  Which I loved  but I have to say Invisible Girl DID NOT DISAPPOINT   Actually I liked this one more  I preordered title and anxiously waited   as soon as it was available I downloaded and was hooked from the start  I finished it in a day and a half  I listened EVERY chance I could on the way to work  at work when my job tasks confined me to my computer  on the way home from work  even connecting to speaker while showering before bed  That is how engrossed I was with OMAGAH     what is going to happen next  MANY times I  thought  I had it figured out but continuing to listen I would think   maybe not     I LOVED ALL of their stories  their lives  SO DIFFERENT but again SO the SAME   ALL I can say is GET THE BOOK     I promise you  it will NOT leave you disappointed   Narration was SUPERB and easy to follow   5 STARS    I immediately listened to the whole thing twice  The first time through to let it sink in uninterrupted and the second to make notes  many  along the way  This is the first of Brene s books I ve read and the others are now on my list  I am going out and buying copies for gifts  it should be required reading in schools  Do yourself a favor for life  and soak in this book  It will change the way you do life  I ve read this book years ago and loved it  So now wanted to have it on audible  I couldn t finish it due to the Narrator s monotone reading Reading all the reviews  I almost didn t buy this just due to the audio quality issues everyone talked about  The issues have been fixed  No replays of some content and all the chapters are there  My only gripe is when Kramer has to read a sultry female character   sounds like a drag queen   kind of takes you out of the moment  Otherwise a really great book  Going to get book 10 now  The premise of the book is great  and I fully agree with it  However  the contents are mostly common sense and I personally didn t find anything I didn t already know and wanted to  in this book  I already shared the author s opinion that deep work is important and desirable before I read  listened to  the book  Unfortunately for me  he spends a huge chunk of the book selling the concept  supported by research evidence no one really needs  do we really need the details of dozens of scientific research projects to believe that we get more done when we direct our undivided attention to one focused  deep work   then proceeds to give okay  but far from groundbreaking advice  such as controlling your schedule  making yourself less accessible to distraction  ignoring social media  etc  The added value in the book would make for a very meaty magazine article  but sadly  it makes a very contentlight book that feels padded  with little substance and nothing ground breaking  I believe that my opinion has to do with the fact that the author is in academia  where an original thought  a completed research project  a dissertation  a well documented academic paper  a lecture  etc  is considered a tangible achievement in and of itself  while I m a business owner i e  I either get stuff done others are willing to pay for or I don t eat  And deep work has always helped me with that  so I didn t need to be sold on that  If you are a creative or business owner  you don t need or have time for 40 pages to make a simple point  You need the gettothepoint summary and then you go deep and execute  or you ll be in deep something else  i loved this book and i could listen to narrator read the back of a cereal box  no one does it better  This may be the best book Ive come across about the relationship between blacks and whites  Nonpolitical  beautifully and honestly told  going back to the Civil War  stopping in 1960s during the riots in Detroit  fast forwarded to current day  Three women  all related Mary  left alone while her husband was off fighting with the Union Army  ran a home for escaped slaves       Nora  a young  well to do white girl in the 1960s who fell in love with a young black photographer       and Elizabeth  a current day journalist  A lot could be learned by reading listening  One thing IS clear  Right from wrong  And it isnt glossed over       or rammed down your throat  From a man sent home in a trunk during the Civil War and beds lined up in an attic  to southern blacks still fleeing to Detroit in the 1960s to work in the auto assembly lines  to men in high places still trying to hide their secret sins today       the author weaves a story of both hope and loss  mistakes and sin  yet a path to forgiveness and restoration       There are no polarizing statements or agendas here  Its about PEOPLE  Rich people  poor people  white people and black people  And the choices that they make  It gives the listener an amazingly birds eye view of the city of Detroit and its history  It will make you want to research and preserve your own ancestry  Most of all it will make you thankful for your blessings and urge you toward forgiving those who have wronged you  especially those you hold dear  I ve watched all of the Maps of Meaning lectures of Dr  Peterson  plus most of his lecture series on Personality I also listened to his Twelve Rules of Life audiobook  I liked all of them  so I thought this book might inspire me even more  Nothing could be further from the truth  alas It s too verbose  has no coherent structure  unlike the lectures  and the chapters are ridiculously long  I mean  11 hours for one chapter for the audio version at least more chapters would have been helpful If you want to get what he s thinking and saying  watch the Maps of Meaning lecture series  all of them  and skip this book His narration is great though  He reads with the same passion he lectures with  and probably writes with too  I find him one of the best narrators for serious works of literature I know  judging from his reading quotes from The Gulag Archipelago  the works of Dostoyevski  Orwell  and several others  He has a real knack for that  I think because he really understands those works and therefore knows which words to emphasize  where to sound appalled or angry  where to raise or lower his volume  etc  If he would narrate those works here on Audible  I d probably buy all of those books  knowing I would get a great understanding of the works through listening to Peterson as narrator  Despite this lessthanstellar review  I actually am a fan of Ferris  I absolutely loved The 4Hour Workweek  I listen to his podcast a decent amount  and Ive read a lot of his stuff online It always pains me to leave lessthanpositive reviews for folks I look up to  but I think a few points need to be made here  As to not harp on the negative  however  Ill start with whats good about this book The GoodThere are so many highprofile and successful folks  the titans  interviewed in this work  Tony Robbins  Seth Rogan  Arnold Schwarzenegger  Whitney Cummings  etc  Its awesome to hear the perspectives of such successful people The book provides countless life hacks  tips  and tricks for the reader to digest and implement In the final hour of the audiobook  Ferris has a section on depression thats really raw and real  Though mental health is something thats very important to me  specifically  I think almost anyone would find this section moving The BadThe book is way too long  This is something I disliked about The 4Hour Body and The 4Hour Chef as well  Writing is just as much about what you leave in as what you leave out  Its just my opinion  but I think the deluge of information here feels slightly lazy  which is a shame  because I know just how much work mustve gone into this book This is where I make myself laugh  but there really is too much good information here  This plays into my previous point  At the end of it  I was frankly overwhelmed  though I had just finished a 700 page book  I still had a long list of other books and movies to check out thanks to the recommendations made here  I was hoping this one would be a beallendall synthesization of good content  not a journey into even more of it In my mind  the formatting and editing miss the mark here  I know Ferris says to jump around and treat the book as an encyclopedia  but I just dont think the content allows for that  If I buy a book filled with interviews from the worlds best  Im probably going to read every interview  Jumping around in this one is also difficult because the interviews are not categorized by subject  That is  you cant jump to the wellness part of the book you can only make guesses as to which interviewees will talk about the subjects youre interested in  and skip there There are many narrators of the audiobook  which can make listening confusing at times Again  as to not harp on the negative  I think Ill probably leave my points at the above you likely see my argument by now  Turning back to the positive  however  there is some seriously good content here  The problem  however  as Ive mentioned  is that you have to wade through so much other content to get to the stuff youre most interested in I saw a review on Amazon that recommended that Ferris come out with a new edition of this book  one that catalogs the information better and provides a useful index  I totally agree  I also dont think it wouldve hurt to have broken this book into multiple titles I dont really see myself revisiting this book  but what I definitely will do is revisit Ferris podcast and his breakout hit  The 4Hour Workweek  That book was one of my favorites when I read it  I think Im overdue to jump back into it So  while I cant say that I fully recommend this one  I also cant say that I dont recommend it  If you are going to jump in  I just suggest that you buckle up and drive slowly  Its a long ride Brian SachettaAuthor of Get Out of Your Head This experience was the perfect way to understand who Thanos is and what he believes his purpose is  After listening to this I wont be able to watch Infinity War the same way Though the message is familiar and can be found in many other books of similar title  the author s voice and delivery brings out the sincerity and power of the words  This is someone speaking from within one s own intimate understanding of the potency of the message  I d recommend it anybody looking to hear simple truth about ourself and be uplifted yet again  I was not sure I d like this book  to be honest  I m not a big fan of mobster type stories  But from the first moment I began to listen  I was enthralled  The action started and just never stopped  Before I knew it I was halfway through it and still listening at every single chance I got  This is a whole new series to jump in on from the ground up  It s incredibly good and well worth the low cost to get it  Nicholas Sansbury Smith continues to wow us with his spectacular ability to weave his world all around us  And when you pair Nick up with Ray Porter  the reading of this incredible book of this is just astounding  As a HUGE fan of this series    this was such a disappointment  Paint  buy gifts  and no questions answered  That is the book pretty much summed up  I know that this was a bridge to spin offs but this could have been done so much better  I almost wish that I would never have read it and just read the spin offs I wanted sooooo much more out of this book after waiting so long for it  Is it just me or is anyone else worn out with this theme  Maybe it would be tolerable if there was some fresh concept  but no  there is not  it has all been covered before  I feel cheated In this story  a young woman discovers that her mom has been hiding the truth about her dad so off she goes to Ireland to track him down  Her best friend is a grossly clichd gay guy sidekick who has the personality of a 1980 s sitcom  Without much prelude  she discovers and accepts that she is a powerful witch and that her new found community needs her to save them Now throw in ALL the other supernaturals you can think of with detailed descriptions of their powers  histories  and relationships  which have no bearing on this story   along with all the contrived names of people and places in the other world where the main character spends time  and you may find yourself wringing your hands trying to keep track of it all   for no reason though  because most of them don t have a storyline yet  Their connecting lines on this flow chart lead to a plot in another book  I suppose  It felt like studying for a test The balance for laying the foundation for a series and weaving a riveting first book in a series is tilted so dramatically that I have zero interest in the next book  I will be returning this one  it really does read like words squashed between blocks in a flow chart  Timothy Zahn is one of the masters of the Star Wars universe  Thrawn is a masterpiece  A character study of one of the most famous and beloved adversaries in the Empire  Grand Admiral Thrawn is not driven by evil or domination  The Sherlock of the Star Wars galaxy  he is a master at military tactics and studies the culture and art of varying species in an effort to understand them  This book gives us insight into Thrawn s thought process as he ascends the imperial ranks  artfully handles core world bigotry  tangles with another tactical master and trains another outer rim outsider in his crafts  I loved watching Thrawn outwit humans who felt far superior and learned they were not  This book also featured the backstory of Lothal governor Pryce and her journey down a dark path of ruthlessness  I read this book using immersion reading  while listening to the brilliant Marc Thompson s incredible narration  His character voices are spot on and his beautiful intonations really make the story come alive  I loved Thrawn s voice  This book is another reason why he is my favorite narrator A must read listen for Star Wars fans  Zahn does not disappoint  Political intrigue  action  drama and excitement await within  I took my time to savor this book and was sad to see it end  I hope we have more of the Grand Admiral s adventures both in print and on the big screen  Ahhh I just love this sweet lovely book  This has the light happy feels that I love from a JQ novels low angst  low drama  no tears and little heartache This book really has the feel of a cozy mystery  When Garett receives his deceased italian grandmothers diary he ask his other grandmother  none other than Lady Danbury herself  who might translate it  Enter Hyacinth Bridgerton  companion to Lady D and totally randomly also passable Italian speaker translator  Gareth and Hyacinth are thus thrown together and mysteries are both resolved and resurfaced by the secrets uncovered in the diary  Along the way Gareth and Hyacinth fall in love  It just a sweet little story of scandal and shenanigans  There is drama with Gareths father being the big old jerk he is but its over shadowed by humor  death by pigeon pecks and jokes about prospective lisping progeny  and hijinks  The issues between Gareth and Hyacinth are pretty quickly resolved by Hyacinths take the bull by its horns attitude  talking their issues out and discussing rather than brooding  I just love that  You get the sense that these two are a team  a unit no matter how they might bicker and argue  I just love it and it fits so well in the Bridgerton universe  Highly recommend for that plus Lady D  plus Anthony  Violet and just the whole Bridgerton experience  The book is wonderful and made even more so by the expertise of the narrators  Since I have used audible com I have found that the quality of the narration is as important as the content These narrators knock it out of the park  As a Southerner I sometimes find my ears offended by poorly executed dialect accents  Not here  Excellent job The story itself grabs you immediately and doesn t let you go  I felt as if I knew each woman personally  Maybe it is because I grew up in the South and have met women similar to each of these steel magnolias  Laura is such a hilarious and beautiful soul  and beyond inspirational  I have been a huge fan of hers beginning with Help Helen Smash but didnt know her backstory   what a roller coaster of challenges she has endured and overcome    Her story about her relationship with her family  trauma from abusive boyfriends  and long road of addiction to her transformed sobriety is so well written  and binge worthy  I listened straight through  Being able to listen to Laura tell her own story was priceless  I am so glad she chose to narrate it  Laura is just so witty and being able to hear her inflections  funny accents  comedic timing  as well as her occasional guest narrator was so special  If you are already a fan  theres no way that you will not love Lauras book If you arent a fan  go watch all of Lauras amazing videos and then enjoy this truly well written and beautifully narrated audiobook  Mr  Harrimans Phone  Chapters 15The Life of Chuck  Chapters 69If It Bleeds  Chapters 1020Rat  Chapters 2162I enjoyed the book and the audio adaptation  My only complaint is with the audible breakdown of not showing which story was which  thats why I wanted to share the confirmed chapter breakdown to the book stories  Hope this helps and hope you enjoy the stories as much as I did  Stay safe and healthy   and slightly scared of what lies o the next page  Only equal in comparison to  The Road Less Traveled   I ve heard many good reviews of the author of this book and will now download his other two books from this site Even if they are merely standing on the shoulders of giants the message is heard loud and clear  Deep profound wisdom  I wish I had read these books many years ago Wisdom is one of the best gifts a person can receive  This was quite good  I became aware of this book from a few positive reviews and once I read the books summary  I knew that I would have to give it a try as well  This was one of those books that I liked more and more as I read  It really didnt take too long before I reached a point where I didnt want to put the book down  I really had a great time reading this book Imagine living each day with the knowledge that you are worth more as a corpse than you are alive  That is exactly the situation that Cora deals with every day  Cora was born with two hearts which makes her very valuable  A fact that she has worked extremely hard to hide  She leads a double life posing as her twin brother  Jacob  when fitting  Cora Jacob helps support her family by acquiring bodies for research and dissection along with her team Individuals with unusual physical features start dying at an alarming rate and bodies are disappearing before Coras group gets the chance to try to get their hands on them  Something is obviously going on and I had a great time trying to figure it all out  Just when I thought that I knew how things might go  something would happen and I would realize that I was completely wrong  I loved that this book kept me guessing  There were several mysteries happening at the same time and I found them all equally interesting and quite complex I thought that the characters were very well done in this book  Cora was smart  tough and resourceful and I found her to be really easy to like  I liked the fact that she was able to really put on a different persona when she was acting as Jacob  Theodore Flint really shook things up a bit in this story and I loved what his character brought to the story  I was never quite sure who should be trusted or which characters would prove to have their own agenda This was my first experience listening to Saskia Maarlevelds narration and I think she did a fabulous job with this story  She really brought the story to life and did a great job with all of the character voices  I think that she was able to express a lot of emotion into her reading which made it possible to really feel what the character is going through at the time  I found that she had a very pleasant reading voice that I found easy to listen to for hours at a time I would highly recommend this book to others  This book had a girl with two hearts  a double life  some grave robbing  a rather complex mystery  a fantastic 1850s New York setting  and even just a bit of romance  I found this to be a highly enjoyable read and cannot wait to read more from this talented author Book source Kindle Unlimited Loved this story  Brought tears and smiles  I felt I was there with the characters  Danielle is a very talented writer and I thank her for sharing  This is my favorite book out of this series  You have to read Outlander to understand what is going on but trust me its well worth it  The characters become like friends and you find yourself caring about them and there story while learning a great deal about Scottish history  Outstanding book  Dr  Jacob  aka Jake  Mitchell is a very successful and caring Cardio Surgeon   hes a handsome  rich  carefree  charismatic Playboy who comes from old money  He  his brother and his best friend make up the Billionaires Club   who avoid the fame hungry gold diggers by only one and done fking rich women with similar lifestyles  But  while in a coffee shop  then a roof top and attending a wedding  he keeps bumping into the same beautiful intriguing woman  Ashleys character  their random lol meetings  the suggestive flirts  easy banter and tempting teases lead to a no strings one night fling   a night and a woman thatll haunt Jakes thoughts for a year  Ashleigh attends a wedding on behalf of her sick father and its there that she bumps into a beautiful  handsome  charismatic  sexy stranger   not once but three times and he will rock her world for one glorious night   but by the morning light she needs to vanish from his life  Both regretted not exchanging numbers but  when Ashleys father has a heart attack  its Dr  Jacob Mitchell who saves him   and what do you know  Fate and Destiny have given these two likeable characters yet another chance to get it right  Which they eventually do   but theres boundaries to establish then blur  the paparazzi to control and struggle with  a healthy heart to be found  a one and done exs drama to handle and their very different lifestyles to merge together  An enjoyable romance with great banter  interesting characters  sizzles and sex  heartache and hiccups and a world too interested in the dreamy doctor  A wee bit insta initially   however the pitfalls means they did have to make it work and the dual POV narration by Sarah and Aiden brought the characters and the story to life  WORTH A CREDIT  Yup  a weighty wellpaced fest of give and take   of family love and loyalty   of thunderbolts  second chances and love  Usually I wouldn t write a review before I had finished a book  but I just can t help myself    I m sure that you hard core WoT fans out there won t need any further encouragement to purchase this one  but for anyone who does    Get it  now    Seriously  it s good  Perhaps I m just not as perceptive as I ought to be  but I ve not yet noticed much difference from the quality that I d expect of a book in this amazing series  So far  I think that Brandon Sanderson has stayed true to the characters that RJ created  and I think his style just works for this series  Needless to say  I am thoroughly enjoying this audiobook so far  I ve already noticed quite a few plot lines moving forward and am learning answers to questions that I ve really been waiting to find out about  I d like to thank Mr  Sanderson for his wonderful work in continuing this series  Robert Jordan for caring enough about his fans to leave behind enough content for Brandon to work with  and of course  his wife Harriet for making a great choice of whom to continue his work  Very respectfully  Dominique  This story revolves around reporter Jack McEvoy and FBI agent Rachel Walling  While I read all of Connelly in order years ago  I actually listened to the sequel of The Poet  the Harry Bosch novel The Narrows  first  Even though I knew who the villain was this was a riveting story You don t have to listen to many of Connelly s novel in order  but it s essential to read the Poet first if you want maximum shock value A great audio experience    I tried fitting in all through my public school years  Then I gave up  dyed my hair  donned combat boots  and started sporting a Mohawk  And I became wildly popular as a nonconformist Still  I was miserable  I had no idea how to be me  whatever that entailed I love Brene Brown  have all her books  and each has inspired me  Still  inspirational and actionable are two different things Finally  Braving the Wilderness has steps one can really  honestly  truly take to get to that fabled goal of Authenticity  Her research brought her to the wonderful checklist  an acronym BRAVING  where B is Boundaries  A is Accountability  I is Integrity  G is Generosity  and the other letters elements are covered also in great detail  The challenges that arise with each of these elements are covered  everything  the whole nine yards Also  and this I thought was brave of her  Brene discusses how exactly we got to be the volatile  fractured nation we are today plus she highlights steps we can take to make our interactions with each other more humane  more transformative  And it s not by staying in our own camps either  I know HARD Her narration is warm  her examples  some her own on how NOT to do something  are enlightening  her hope is genuine and contagious Okay  so no Mohawk here  But I am ready to take those fearsome  courageous  first few steps     If you were like me and thought that Star Wars episodes IIII were ruled by special effects and the music of John Williams rather than an epic story with epic characters  then you need to read hear this book  You will come to understand the nature and history of the Bannite Sith Order  and the masterful and ruthless subterfuge that resulted in the fall of the Galactic Republic and the Jedi order All of the characters from episodes IIII are given greater depth and texture than could be conveyed in the roughly 8 hours of film in the movies  Emperor Palpatine will no longer be just a stooped gravellyvoiced shadow hidden in a cowl to you after this  Darth Maul will be more than a silent  scowling killer wielding an exotic weapon  Count Dooku will no longer seem like Saruman in a cape and boots  The mystery of the death of Jedi Master Sifo Diyas will puzzle you the same way it puzzled the Jedi Council And you will understand that Anakin Skywalker was destined for greatness  but NOT in the way that the Jedi imagined when they accepted him for training  I didn t even know this was a book until somebody had done a comic based on this book that I thoroughly enjoyed but was too impatient to wait for the next week  and somebody put in the comments that this was a book and oh my goodness I m so glad they did AND talk about a cliff hanger ending  Immediately engrossing and the pace and the entertainment dont slacken  Echoes of Pillars and other Follet tales of the middle ages with monks  priests  artisans  nobles  nuns  heroes and heroines  with the type of plotting and character interactions that have you cheering and sneering and cursing and reaching for the next chapter to see how it all comes out  And then you wish it was double the length All with the refreshing political incorrectnesses with which real life resonates Highly  highly recommended  I waited til I d listened to all four books      The first two books in the series were a great pleasure to listen to  the female protagonist had great depth  paranormal insights  some powers and powers adding  and a fabulously loyal friend  She had four men of various godly types show up to guard her and convince her she had to give up her earthly life and go to hell with them on a mission  it s a great story line  and the author did a really fun job of writing the first two books in the series  I so admired the female lead s attitude toward the men  who of course oozed sexual appeal  of demanding that they show their worthiness of her sexual attention  and in the first two books  she held them at bay  demanding their respect of her as an adult  who could make her own decisions  and  unless you like really funky sex scenes spelled out in great detail  multiple partners  multiple orifices  you might want to skip book 3 and just go to book 4  if you ve already listened to 1 and 2 in the series  The first two books are fun  Three and four are strewn with moaning and sex  alternating with a serious as death mission to hell  See my review of book 3 and 4  The first two books were great  if the author had continued on with the same sassy  woman in control   prove you are worth my affection  attitude  even with the mission to hell  and continued requiring the men to learn to treat her as an adult capable of rational thought and reasoning  and then finished off book 4 with her acceptance of them and the sexual activities  I d have five starred all four books all around even with the funky submissive sex  luckily  book four completed the series  as I don t think I could have waded through any more  I love pain  comments  whining for sex  biting til the partner bleeds  etc etc to get to the  actually very satisfactory  conclusion of the book series in book 4  I was so looking forward to reading this book  And very happy it was available on Audible I really appreciated the tone and message of the book  I read it straight thru couldnt put it down  I recognized my previously ignored white privilege as the stories unfolded  painful at times to listen thru the details  Loved the interviews with artists and activists  I have shared with all my friends who are on a similar journey of self improvement Thank you for this a book certain to spread awareness and make the world a kinder  more beautiful place  I thought that reading a book could not be improved on  I was wrong  Abby Craden has brought this excellent book to life  I cannot think of a better narrator to do EJ Noyes books into the audio world  This book should be number one in a number of categories not just Lesbian Romance  I have already preordered EJs next book and cant wait  I am a novice investor  so this seemed to be a good purchase to help acquaint myself with the terms and a broad overview of how the stock market works  I did learn a lot  that s for sure  I also have not had a chance to review any accompanying reference materials  That said  this is a quick listen  almost TOO quick  Acronyms are explained once  almost in passing  then never explained or reminders provided again  At one point  I completely lost the sentence due to all the acronyms and terminology that had only been explained quickly and one time  With a few more listens  I think I will get the full value out of this book  as it is definitely a keeper  but I may find myself supplementing it with a combination of a Great Courses programs and some kind of  investing for dummies  book  just to ensure I understand the basics more thoroughly  Definitely a recommended listen read  even with all the internal website promotions  If you enjoyed WATCHERS then you should also like DEVOTED  If youve never read WATCHERS but love dogs and would like one who can communicate with you through actual words and thoughts as an equal intelligent being  then this is the book for you Kip is a descendant of the original experimental genetically altered dog  He belonged to Dorothy who got him as a puppy  Once she realized what a unique dog he was she began to teach him  Upon her death Kip takes off to save an autistic boy who is a genius After hacking into a murder for hire dark web site  his  Woodys  snooping is discovered  Shortly after some very bad people would like to get their hands on him  Woody knows too much  like these are the people who murdered his father Edoardo Ballerini is the best  His narration is superbThis book has my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank You  Not sure why there are so many negative reviews  I often wonder what people expect from a King novel  I couldnt stop listening to this audio book Pattons reading was utterly brilliant  He has a quite voice but his performance really draws you in deep  The story build beautifully reminded me a lot of True Detective but with a much better ending  Similar to Revival in how it builds and builds right up to the end only on a smaller scale  However I enjoyed the ending a lot more than Revivals end  Both are great stories though King still proves why he wears the crown I am a HUGE fan of Susan Stoker s work and have read and or listened to everything out there  I was so excited for this one to be released  While the story is great  I really wish I had bought the book to read myself instead of the audible version   which I will be buying  At times I felt like I was listening to a computer generated voice reading an instruction manual  PLEASE bring back Stella Bloom or Savannah Peachwood to narrate the other books in this series    Any book by Brandon Sanderson is a good book  I would not rate this among his best  however  It s entertaining  sure  but it was slow to hook me  Unlike his other books  I found it difficult to become emotionally invested in the characters  It was only in the last third of the novel  when the plot twists started to pay off  that I really began to enjoy it  I love the author and have purchased nearly all of his work  I listen to them repeatedly  Which is why I preordered this book and eagerly awaited some fresh Sedaris material  However  the only new material  for me  was a wonderful essay about his brother Paul  I was not interested enough to listen to the interview with the author  which would have added further  new material   But is that truly a work by the author  I am in it for the essays  They are hilarious and profound  Also  I believe I was expecting fresh recordings of his favorite works  but they seem to be the old studio recordings from the audioboks that I ve previously purchased  Please  Mr  Sedaris   write  and record  more  I have only huge enthusiastic praise for this enthralling  mesmerizing series I am completely wrapped up in the characters and they are so vivid  so beautifully drawn that I feel I am in their world along with them I also cannot heap enough praise upon Davina Porter  the narrator of this extraordinary series She is magnificenther voices make every character come alive and her accents are impeccable  as well as her tone whether the character be male or female I have to drag myself away from listening and I am continually finding things to do just so I can continue listening This is the 4th book in the series and I keep wanting to slow down because I don t want it to end I have got to write Diana Gabaldon and lavish her with overwhelming praise as I genuflect before her I don t want to give away any plot and spoil anything for those who haven t yet read this series  But the twists and turns the wonderful way that Ms  Gabaldon weaves the characters in and out of the saga the horrific events and the charming moments as well as the absolutely gorgeous  romantic sex will keep you enthralled Okay  Can you tell that I like this book  Fortunately the author and her agent have negotiated a change in her copyright contract to allow the sale of the unabridged version  Part of the agreement is that the abridged must remain available but that hopefully won t tempt anyone with a modest amount of good sense  After all how can you modify a book so large into such a small recording   not without mangling it bad  The author is well known to dislike the abridged versions of her novels and is anxious that the remaining one  The Fiery Cross  be available in unabridged form around Nov  of 2011  As always I recommend reading the novels in order to get full benefit of the story of Claire and Jamie Outlander  Dragonfly in Amber  Voyager  Drums of Autumn  Fiery Cross  A Breath of Snow and Ashes  and Echo in the Bone  Each is technically self standing but each builds on its predecessors and you will be very happy to discover older characters and evens  So if you haven t read any of the Outlander series yet do start with the first  Outlander  You ll be glad you did  A Breath of Snow and Ashes is worth waiting for anyway    Wow  Such a revealing book  especially for someone like myself that went through a highly religious and intolerant phase in my life based off my beliefs and the ideologies of the religion I followed  I recommend this book to anyone that is seeking the truth of the origins of humanity  and not in some fantastical way  but in a scientific way that can be and has been proved through modern discovery and time  What I love about this book is the way that Carl Sagan is able to demonstrate that we need that fine balance between openness and skepticism to discover truth  And being a skeptic on any scientific or religious matter is not a cause to rebuke or defame you  as some people would have  In the end  without science we would still be in the Dark Ages  Outstanding book from the great mind of the humble Carl Sagan  Brandon Sanderson really understands this wonderful world that Robert Jordan has created  I am saddened that we will only get one more book and then nothing but imagination  I have listened to all of the books in this series and I remain captivated by the charactors and the Narration  Kate Redding is really the best there is and there would be no Matt without Micheal Kramer  Mr  Sanderson has another loyal follower  First off  Davina Porter is hands down my favorite voice ever  no contest  I m tempted to buy other audio she has done just to listen to a masterful voice actress  As far as Echo goes  I enjoyed it as much as any other Outlander book to date  I have an understanding that this feels like a transitional book  because Jamie and Claire can t live forever  but the character development of Roger  Brianna  Jeremiah and William are comforting for a potential new series  The thing I appreciate the most is an extremely long story that has such vivid detail and picks up and answers questions that may have been left in past outlander books  I actually get a little sad when the book is done because I know it will be some time before another new work is released  Thanks Diana and Davina   Why is this excellent  powerful record not REQUIRED READING for US students  Its a damned shame that the sickness of Marxism has taken such hold here    wake up Americans  Jesus  Im not religious This has to be the hottestnay  the HOTTEST f f ice queen older woman I didnt know I was gay romance novel yet It took a few chapters for me to warm up to the Southern accent  but I really couldnt hear accents for long  due to the pulse in my face heart palpitations stirring in various body parts  etc Its high praise to the author and orator when its 330am and I have no intention of turning the book off or going to bed    although I truly believe in his message  the selfproclaimed messenger is not delivering anything that has not been told Before in a  in my opinion Better way  Dutch is Back  but this isn t what makes the story worth the time  Almost everything we know about the Predators from the films is mentioned  Dutch s story is eventually revealed  which isn t really a surprise  The main character is fleshed out as good as any Soldier would lively admit The Predators are mentioned only when the need is relevant  Sure there are things that could have been developed more about them  but the mystery about them is what makes this story click The Story is well written and moves at a casual pace when needed  The performance is pretty good  except when Dutch is portrayed  I m not a fan of Dutch s voice in this  Still this is completely worth the read or listen Predator  AVP Fans should enjoy this one  If you enjoyed Tim Libbon s Rage War series  which goes into more detail on the Predators   then you ll have fun with this one too  I was hesitant to buy this book because I d never heard of the author and only had a few Amazon reviews to go on  but I listened to the sample and liked the narration  and liked that the book hadn t been loaded with obviously fake reviews as so often happens on Audible  so I figured I d give it a shot  I listened to the book straight through after buying  and I have nothing but good things to say about it  Not only is the narration conversational and engaging  the content is ACTUALLY GOOD  Not a bunch of silliness and vague ideas and humblebrag filler  but wellstated truths and actionable pushes in the right direction I m into the whole self help thing  and I can t stand books of this type that are simply entertaining but lack actual substance because I want to do the work the book is  at least supposed to be  about and use it as a way to focus on what I m doing and keep myself motivated  This one hit all of my  high and fussy  marks for a book of this type  If you re on the fence about buying because you don t like fluffy  useless self help books and worry this might be one  it s not  I say go for it  STORY  Dance Upon the Air reminds me a lot of the Julia Roberts movie Sleeping with the Enemy  Not the same  of course  but there are a lot of similarities  It is a small town contemporary romance that has an undertone of danger and a dabbling in witchcraft  The romance is engaging  and the impending danger will keep you on your toes  Nell and Zack are strong  smart  likeable characters  and I enjoyed hearing their relationship progress  As always  Nora Roberts  sex scenes are tastefully described but still very passionate  I enjoyed this book a lot  but I ve gotten very stingey with my 4 s and 5 s so I ve just rated it a 3 NARRATOR  Good job but nothing special  Zack s voice was a bit nasally  but way better than a lot of men s voices done by women  and vice versa  OVERALL  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good  clean  romance  If you are looking for lots of hot sex  you should probably skip this one  This was a beautiful and emotional story performed by the best of the best of narrators  JF Harding and Jack DuPont completely brought this story alive for me I am ready for book 2 of the series  and I truly hope the author intends to use these master performers  If youre a fan of T R Ragan then youre familiar with her formula for writing a story 1  There is a common atrocious issue 2  The issue is not being dealt with properly by society or law enforcement 3  A group of wronged individuals set an agreeable goal to take care of the problem 4  Everyone has a nickname There is always a good story with lots of tension  Often there are multiple plots  as in this book   there are also two locations  The characters are fleshed out and although some have been brutalized they never appear as victims  Only slightly broken Jennica Damon does an excellent job narrating HIGHLY RECOMMENDED If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank you  I first started listening to this series because i found it was suggested on a  books similar to Harry Potter  search I did  I ll be honest  I wasn t expecting much The first book was good  It seemed a little cliche at first  and it felt like the narrator hadn t quite mastered her craft  And yet  I downloaded the second book immediately after I finished the first  The second was better  There were some palpable plot twists  more complex characters  and the boom wasn t afraid to get a little darker  which I loved But then  bam  this third novel hits you like a freight train  Intense  emotionally and psychologically gripping writing  And the narrator has really come into her own  She s like a different person Honestly  never thought I d be recommending this series so strongly  but you should read it  I m downloading the 4th one right now   I am a big fan of this genre  read Dresden Files  Iron Druid Chronicles   Unfortunately  this one didn t move me to the same degree  I certainly don t regret the credit I spent on it and there was no part where the story bogged down and became a slog  I m just not totally convinced to drop more credits on the rest of the series I like the world Briggs has created with elements of the square community  vanilla humans  beginning to confront the arcane community  werewolves  vampires  the fae  openly  The idea of some fae already being revealed to the world but many still maintaining their secret is a good setup Mercy herself  with her modest known abilities and the hints about much greater abilities  is similarly well set up to be a source of magical and human conflict The supporting cast of characters is well developed without forcing it  This is particularly well done because Briggs is working against a tendency to make all beings of a sort  like werewolves  have similar personalities  While hers have similar traits  they are very distinct Also there is plenty of action  preternatural and otherwise My major problem with the book is that Mercy lacks agency within the plot  There are some moments in the story when her actions are pivotal to the scene  but you get the feeling that the outcome didn t result because of any of Mercy s major decisions  actions or insights  Sure  she figures out the mystery one half second before everyone else  but it is at the point where it is already moot  Mercy doesn t drive the story the story pulls her along  That s fine in the beginning of a story  but as it progresses  you want to see your protagonist take control King s telling of the story is good  She does a husky man voice passing fair I liked her take on foreign accents  One issue I would take is that Mercy is supposed to be early 30s and I feel like King has her dialed in at about mid 40s  But generally  a sound reading  Narrators matter and it is rare for me to buy an audiobook that I already own  and enjoy just to hear another perspective in the way it is read  But this book lends itself to the two pretty much different voices  Sledge wrote this book about his combat experience in his maturity  I think like many veterans of war  especially ground combat  some distance  in terms of years  often decades  is required to tell the story  But E  B  Sledge lived it and survived it  and not just physically  as a young man George Wilson does a terrific job of telling this story as an adult explaining what happened  in the voice of someone who not only survived  but is strong enough to remember and acknowledge the ordinary people who accomplished remarkable things  good  bad  and horrific  The drama comes from the written word  and Sledge does not add many flourishes  The stated facts of what he saw and experienced do not need them Marc Vietor reads in the voice of the young man experiencing the fatigue  terror and even humor  of the ground combat soldier in the Pacific of World War II  It is good to remember that Sledge and his fellow marines were very young  In another time they would have been deciding what they would do when they grew up  In that time they were just trying to stay alive to grow up I am glad I indulged myself and bought both books  This book has been more than I expected    It took me a few weeks to read because it was so triggering  I ve been working on my mental health for a while now and this book has given me a better understanding and Clarity that im on the right track  I ve always feel like I held a LOT of trauma in my body but I just didn t really have a name for  This is a book that everyone should read  Anyone that feels lost and stuck and grave a sense to belong a sense to understanding  I m not lucky enough to have a grandmother or even a mother to feed energy off of  But Iam a person that ALWAYS knew I was special  blessed  This book will be something I will reread over and over again   Im very happy I came across this thanks to someone I follow on IG   acehood wife  forget her IG name but anyways get this book  I brought the hard copy and the audible version   If youre a Christian woman you will enjoy this bookIf youre a Christian man youre understanding about women in the Bible and women in general might expand If youre not a Christian youre understanding of Christians may improve And if youre a non believer I think you will enjoy these stories about women whose lives have been portrayed in the story of life on earth  also known as the Bible  The narrator was very good SPOILER ALERT  Don t read further if you don t want an inkling of a spoiler The story started out strong  however  as it progressed the narrative became more like some teenage boy fantasy  Think sexy HAI robot and the geeky guy who is conveniently the last man in the universe  At that point in the tale I starting rolling my eyes  I stuck with it though hoping for the big reveal  but in the end all the story really just was a lame  teenage boy fantasy  I want those hours of my life back  but nothing new here and certainly will not END your anxiety  even the book will say things like manage and accept  It is a huge amount of Cognitive Behavioral Monitoring and massive amounts of work to do on your own  Lot s of recommendations for therapy  Why sell a book that claims to rewire your brain and end anxiety when it doesn t Mediate  watch your thoughts  journal  exercise  eat right sound familiar  Good basic advice you can get for free from your auntie or the internet  Explaining the difference between limbic amygdala anxiety and cortex anxiety  while interesting doesn t really help much  Just my opinion  I truly hope others have success  After physically reading the novellas in Assassins Blade as well as the first book Throne of Glass I stumbled upon this Audio version of book two and in my haste to find out what happens next decided to listen instead of read  Let me just say  IT  WAS  EXCEPTIONAL   Experiencing such intricate stories  plot twists and developments from such a talented writer through audio   Im never going back to traditional reading after this  I must say 10 10 Fully Recommend  If you could sum up Written in My Own Heart s Blood in three words  what would they be  John Scalzi always seems to come up with new ideas or new twists on old ideas  is there really anything new under the sun    The premise is one of the most terrifying things that could happen to a person  Its worse than life imprisonment in solitary confinement  In solitary you can stand  sit  move around  not much  but you can move   smell  but you might not want too   talk  feel  and see  Now imagine a virus that causes millions round the world to die  worse than the Spanish Flu of 19181920  Of those that recover 99  go on with their lives  For other 1  4 million in the US alone   it causes a person to be locked into their body  awake and aware of the world around them  yet incapable of seeing  moving  or communicating  unable  luckily   to even taste the gruel that is piped into their body  Hundreds of millions in the US a around the world have been ravished by this disease  and it continues to strike down more victims every year But into this chamber of horror comes a ray of light  an open door leading back to the world  in the form an external body that sort of looks like the Droid CP3O  At least that is the style for the First Lady  an early victim of the virus  Hadens syndrome  Named for its most public and well know victim  herself  the Presidents wife  The First Lady has been given the first external body  our hero  Chris Shane  a child at the time  was granted the second  a child size version and becomes Hadens syndromes second most famous victim  Yet through the adversity Chris becomes a beacon of hope for those suffering from this modern black plague  More than twenty years have gone by since the first outbreak Chris is now a fledgling FBI agent and is trying to step out of the spotlight  into making a real life The second day on the job  the rookie Chris and new partner Agent Vann meet in front of the Watergate Hotel  The meeting spot is next to car that is sporting a love seat  embedded in the roof after being thrown through a seventh floor window  From this point on you are trapped in a twisted and totally enjoyable world pulled from the mind of John Scalzi A truly wondrous place to be On the narratorsOne of the more interesting curves is that Scalzi never hints at Chris Shanes sex  So having Amber Benson and Wil Wheaton narrate individual versions is now more reasonable to me  I picked Ambers version and wish that I had also picked up Wils so I could have compared them in their entirety  I have been a fan of both actors since the days of Star Trek  the Next Generation and Buffy the Vampire Slayer  I decided on Ambers version because I had the pleasure of catching Wil on several other books and I wished to hear Amber tackle this project Amber Benson  held her own as a late comer to Buffy  Even surrounded by a powerful cast of actors  she stood out early enough to really earn the prized role of Willows  Alyson Hannigan  better half  through 47 episodes  Narrating  Locked In Amber seems to start off slow  but then you realize that she is reading a report from a government agency  so its going to be a bit flat  The characterization starts building from Chapter 2 and  for the most part  is strong and clear  Very captivating  it allows you to lean back and take pleasure in the theater of the mind that John and Amber weave for you One note on Wils reading  I have only heard the five minute sample of his interpretation of the text  and its typical Wheaton  Crisp  clear and full of impact  and swift  it seems powerful and should also be a good experience  The author skillfully weaves together the stories of many of the Japanese American men  women and children whose lives were interrupted and who were sorely treated following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941  This is the telling of the stories from not only the viewpoint of men suspected of being too closely connected to Japan  but also the viewpoint of wives left to manage on their own  and teenage children coming of age with a determination to prove their loyalty to the USA  land of their birth  It is a detailed account of the now famous 442  As I listened  I found myself checking the map to see the places where the men fought  6  7 years and we get half a book I have missed Harry    and this is very much our Harry   But to pay full price for a book and get half a book in return   Only to be hyped  by the publisher  that another one is  coming soon  smacks of dividing one book in half and charging full price x2 I m not a fan of stuff like this Jim has earned enough of my good will to get a pass Once  How did Dan Bittner get to narrate this book  All Star Wars books should be narrated by Marc Thompson  If Marc narrated this book it would have been better  Very inspiring book  Raise style and dedication to quality and integrity is uplifting  I would highly recommend any entrepreneur read it I read this book when it came out in the 90 s and loved it  Recently while planning a vacation to Savannah  I decided to listen to it again  I forgot how good it is  the characters  the humor  the stories  and side plots  What a wonderful combination to round out a nice thriller and mystery  Even if you read it 15 years ago  I recommend revisiting it  I consume at least 4 books a month  and rarely do I laugh out loud while listening to a book This is based on a true story  although the author was not there when Williams killed Hansford  but he does explain the circumstances of writing himself as the only fictional character  until he catches up with himself after the murder  in the interview that takes place after the book If you like humor and intrigue nicely wrapped up in a GREAT story  this is a wonderful book I highly recommend it    Inspirational  informative  eyeopening book read by Deepak  Well worth the  and or credit  I will listen to this book at least two more times to absorb all he is sharing  If you want to better yourself and your present state of being  this is a fabulous book for you  This is exactly what I was looking for and what I need  Very easy to read  listen and easy to understand  I love that this book includes exercise that I can try  Thank you  Very good narration and moments of solid research can t save this flawed true crime story  Despite my inclination to agree with many conclusions and lines of speculation  my eyes roll out of my head when hearing such matter of fact telling of how Yonkers was overrun with Satan Worship  human sacrifice  occult subterfuge  and more witches per capita than Salem  Mass  in  the burning times  I did enjoy the detail of witness reports  but the author falls into the ol  Robert Graysmith folly of making the story more about the tribulations they faced while writing  It isn t Rennerlevel selfserving  but the narrative is saturated with personal detail  Full disclosure  I highly disliked the very popular I ll Be Gone In The Dark for the same reason Worth a credit  Yes  Three stars is average  and this audiobook has just as many good points as bad  The Strike books are  by far  my favorite audiobook series  They are the Harry Potter of my adulthoodI can t wait for the next one to come  and it s like Christmas morning when they do  Robert Glenister is a masterful narrator  I am endlessly in awe of his ability to switch between accents  emphasize charactertocharacter specificities  and maintain them across all 5 books When I saw that this book was 30 hours  I was delighted and a little nervous  Lethal White  which I still enjoyed  was more meandering than the other books  and that was just 22 hours long  but Troubled Blood was my favorite book in the series thus far  I adored the occult aspect  the cold case  andof courselearning more about the personal lives of Strike and Robin  There are a ton of characters and a lot of leads to follow  but it seemed more fluid and natural than Lethal White s convoluted plot  The ending came from left field  and yet it all made sense  I cannot wait to listen to it again  And again  And again I was a bit worried about this one  given the initial press about the book being antitrans  The line I remember reading from one of those reviews is something like  the lesson is clear never trust a man in a dress   I did not sense any antitrans sentiment from the book  unless mentioning a serial killer s occasional MO of dressing up as a woman three times in a 900 page book qualifies  For what it s worth  Ive been anticipating this book for a long time and it didnt disappoint  It wasnt quite as good as the author s first book  The Ones We Choose but I think that was simply because the overall theme of the book wasnt quite as interesting to me The characters were realistic and well developed  The plot progressed well and the suspense was good  I loved the authors use of language and the way she described everyday things so vividly and poetically I thought the ending was a bit too easy and would have liked a bit more suspense  But it was satisfying This was the first book Ive listened to narrated by Khristine Hvam  She did a great job  as did Lauren Fortgang  in the alternating narrative  Having read the original how to win friends  I noticed several of the exact same stories and lessons from the original text  Still they are certainly adequate stories that are appropriate for the lessons being taught  Well written and informative  But the main theme i got is if you wouldn t say it to your mom  don t post it on the net or in any social media  The original text seemed to have more  meat and potatoes  contained within the pages  This one seems to focus on what to post and not to post in social media  If you only read one of the two books  digital age or the original title  Id suggest reading the original  When the original text focuses on appropriate  snail mail  etiquette  the new version bears the same message substituting various  social media  for  letter  If you can make that mental substitution  just read the original text and you can get 9095 of the New version s material from the original and maybe 20 more material that was cut for the digital edition  No details just blah blah blahhh  Would appreciate more directness and less this book is for you talk  Would you listen to A Pocket Full of Rye again  Why  I have been a huge fan of Olivia s for the better part of 5 decades  I entertain because of her  I have waited a very long time for this peek into her very private life  I was not disappointed  I chose to listen to the audio book first because I knew she narrated her own story  I wanted to hear her feelings  and I wasn t disappointed  I felt every feeling with Olivia  Her story is even more inspiring than I knew  I shed many tears as my heart broke when hers did  I laughed at her early stories while listening to the utter joy in her voice as she fondly reminisced  Her wellness journey  her winning cancer is nothing short of awe inspiring  As I finished this fantastic book  I realized that  other than my mother  I couldn t have chosen a better role model for my life  I will never be able to thank her enough  Get her book  and support the Olivia NewtonJohn cancer and Wellness Center  I want to thank Audible reviewer Wayne for pointing me to this book  I totally missed this one I thought this was a very good book  Completely different from the Jack Stratton novels which are fast and fun  This book is a little more serious  I wouldn t say more complex but I wouldn t call it fun  Definitely fast paced with a wide variety of murder suspects  By the time I got to the end I had kind of guessed who done it but was still a little surprised when that person was confirmed  All of the loose ends were not neatly tied up but I guess the author leaves that up to the listeners imagination  unless he intends to write another Amy McFadden did a wonderful job narrating  Her voice fit the main character perfectly HIGHLY RECOMMENDED If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank You  Ive been to Italy a few times  My brother lived in Bologna for five years  Its my favorite of all the countries I have traveled  The people are welcoming  The food is homemade  The language wraps itself around my heart  Tembi captures everything I love about Italy  She dares to put her heart on her sleeve and bravely leaves it for all to see  Thank you for this magical  vulnerable story that makes me crave pasta  lentils  ricotta and mint  And  makes me hope to have a life that is as rich as yours  This book is short and simple yet complete  It s very applicable with lots of great questions and examples  As a person who is an analyst and problem solver  almost as soon as someone presents a situation to me in the form of a sentence  I would provide a solution  People don t like that and it s annoying  As a result  I have been working on communication and asking questions  The book provided me with more why  more questions  and perspective  I have ordered a physical copy of the book for each person at my company  I feel it will help me make questions more of a habit  After all  as a problem solver I have a natural curiosity  just need to harness it for the better This book  while being a very insight and beautiful look into the life of Chris Farley  is more of a threepart eulogy  It will make you laugh but sits under a cloud of despair while it does it  Finished it in three days because even in death and through others  stories  Chris Farley is still someone that can grab and hold your attention  I heard this guy on Mark Divines podcast and figured Id give it a try  Ive read over 100 books on self development or biographies  and this is certainly among my top 5  Strongly recommend  will be purchasing this as a gift for friends  Great job Ryan  A hard to swallow pill  but absolutely excellent and necessary introduction to this period of American history post WWI  which is inextricably African American history in this country in its truthfulness  Would highly recommend to every American  its important we know our history  embrace it  learn from it   dump the tragedy of fraudulent revisionist tactics in teaching American history  Well this book has made me change my tune  I would never have thought that I would actually enjoy a Slice of life book  but that is really all this book is as it follows around an average schlub named Phil who is in a loveless marriage  is unemployed  and has no ambition  Phil suddenly finds himself awakened to the realization that he is in a game and that he can level up  gain skills  make friends  and influence people  That is all the book is about  Phil slowly turning his life around one step at a time through meaningful social interactions That is what really stunned me  Dan Sugralinov made a book about going to the gym  buying an apartment  getting a dog  and making friends really exciting  Honestly  If you told me I would even read a book like this and loved it I would have said you were insane  I read fantasy and sci fi to avoid mundane stuff like that  but this book  with the wiley addition of the Lit Elements cleverly keeps all of the everyday stuff in the fun zone  Honestly  reading about a dude going to his estranged wifes hotel room to make sure she is safe is not something that I would even glance at  by dang if Sugralinov didnt keep me hooked the entire time The premise is brilliant  and is handled adeptly and wisely and he manages to balance the real world antics with game elements so that at no point was I bored or wishing for my life to end as so many books do to me  I actually cared about Phil  and got mad right along with him when something crappy happened to him  I hate to admit it  but the book was a roller coaster that really went from highs to lows really fast The narration was above average  but again I wasnt overwhelmed  I have pretty high standards  and am used to Hays  Pohdel  Daniels  Parsanau  Rennie  Scarlato  and Toma setting such high standards that a good narrator comes across a lot weaker than he or she actually is  Either way  it takes a lot to impress me  Ramon De Ocampo does a nice job and manages to add vocal elements such as voices and emotion  and he has nice pacing I did have a little issue with the translations  for example one line that stands out in my mind was  We made it back home without any further innuendo  There was no innuendo before that statement was made  and it occurred again later  Some things just got mixed up or were misunderstood and I have to wonder if these translators ever looked at the spirit of the sentence or just words  Ive studied Latin and ASL  and My Latin teacher would say that you needed to see the bigger picture when translating  you couldnt look at a sentence word by word and get it right  there was more to it  I think that is what happened here  Still  the overall translation was pretty smooth I loved every minute of this book  It had real heart and made me enjoy everyday life type stories  and actually made me consider that I might want to start living my life like I was in a video game  but then I realized two things  First  Id have to go to the gym and that I already live my life by code based on a cherished movie  I cant go changing lifestyle creeds midstream My final score is 8 4  This is a strong first book to what looks like an amazing series  and I for one want another slice Even though I did receive a promo code for this review it in no way influenced my considerations of the material  and in fact  inspired me to be more honest  Getting a code generally makes me harsher as a reviewer as I am more often concerned what someone like Me will decide based on my review If this review helped  please press the YES below  Thank you immensely   As seen on the LITRPG AUDIOBOOK PODCAST  please check it out on Youtube com I heard about this book on the Greg Fitzsimmons podcasts and it sounded interesting  If you dont like real crime and conspiracies  this might not be your cup of tea  I loved all details about the characters and how they dovetailed into the American culture of the 60s  Im in my 50s and I recognized many of the references  I appreciated the thoroughness of the author and his extensive interviews  I couldnt believe how fast this book went I listened every spare minute of the day  I first discovered The Dresden Files series on NetFlix and was instantly hooked  I was nervous about reading Jim Butcher s books after seeing the series  worrying that my preconceptions and possible knowledge of plotlines might take away from the experience  but there s so much more to the characters and stories that I didn t even think of the TV series as I listened  Wonderful characters  wonderful stories  wonderful prose  I liked Marster s narration better in the second book  In fact  as much as I loved the first book  I found the second far more enjoyable  suspenseful  and thought provoking  What the heck with up with the synopsis summary of this book   I put off buying this because the synopsis made this book sounds terrible but after reading through all of Uglands Good Guy series and having my craving for more reach a crescendo  I finally gave in This book is GREAT  If you like The Good Guys series  you will like this  The main character was never described as a former neckbeard  he was a burglar with a gymnastics background and compelling motivations  I dunno where the whole thing about chicken fingers comes from either  They are never mentioned The author needs to fix the damned synopsis  Maybe it was from a earlier draft  I was pulled to this audio book because a psychic told me a few months ago that someone that has crossed was trying to reach me  She said that for some reason  I was not getting the messages  As I listened to the stories  I realized I needed to be open to receiving the messages  Well  that was all it took  For the past few days I have been receiving so many messages from my grandmother  I can t even begin to describe how crazy and awesome and emotional and beautiful this experience has been  There is no doubt in my mind that it is her reaching out to me  This book was awesome  The narration was very engaging and easy to follow along  I highly recommend this book  I love character driven stories  this one had you connecting with the characters  and I liked the work up to the romantic part  I hate books where theres no chemistry or they jump to I ll die without you after knowing them all of a week in a high stress situation  this is not one of those  and its totally acceptable for younger teen audience  I wish I could find more like it  I loved Sapiens and Dues  recommended to many friends and family  I was really excited for this book but was disappointed as so much of it was repeat from earlier books  it felt like the Cliff Notes for Dues  If I hadn t read the other books this would be 5  all the way  but I did    Anyone who consumes Rhett and Link content will enjoy this 5 hour audio experience  Cameo appearances by the mythical crew  their  wifes   and stories you have never heard before make this audiobook worth listening to  Friendships like Rhett and Link are very unique  hearing them read their own work is rewarding As a preChia Lincoln follower it was fun to hear them talk about videos I had seen  For those who haven t heard of Rhett And Link  you are opening a wardrobe door into a magical world of internetainment  First of all  I adore this book series  Right from the beginning  Having said that Chaol is not my favorite character by any means  He s blindly loyal  broods too much  and has made some really bad decisions   which is exactly why we needed this book  I want to go right back to where we left Aelin  but the fact is that this book tied several pieces of information together  We learned so much new information as well  and Chaol got a lot of personal redemption  He s still not my favorite character  but I really like Yrene  We got a ton of character development out of Nezrin  which was needed In the end  this will not be anyone s favorite book of the series  but it is a necessary part of the whole  The stuff they don t want you to know  It s commonsense Come on  people  don t let them own us  I really enjoyed this story  I just finished the second story  and I thought I would share my comments here also as they apply equally to both  The narration was driving me INSANE  he speaks so slowly and deliberately  Then I found the setting to speed up the audiobook playback to faster  WHAT a relief  I am actually enjoying the story now  His female voices are still poor and his kids  voices make me cringe  All the adult characters sound very similar except Ryder  Too bad this is Beckett s story  I like the family  I like the locale  and I like the pets  especially D A   Dumb Ass  The Inn Boonsboro Trilogy is also very unusual  in that Boonsboro is a real town and the businesses named really exist and are actually owned by Nora Roberts and or her family  They rehabbed the historic inn  had a terrible fire while it was under construction and had to start over  You can actually go and stay in the rooms  which are all named after famous fictional couples  although I suspect the ghost in the Elizabeth  Darcy room is a literary device  I also thought it was great fun that they have an Eve  Roarke room  the husband and wife team that is featured in 40 Eve Dallas stories by Nora Roberts writing as J D  Robb  my alltime FAVORITE series  with fantastic narration by Susan Erickson what a joy they are to listen to  Turn the Page Bookstore is owned by the Roberts and it is where all her book signings take place  in fact it is the only bookstore to offered books signed by the Nora  Vesta Pizza is real and really offers room service to the Inn  and Gifts Inn Boonsboro is real too  If you go to Nora s website there is a link to the bookstore and Inn I think it is fun that she used her actual experiences of going through the rehab  setting her fictional characters against a true setting  But I think I would like it better if Nora was open about her connection to these businesses  Without the open acknowledgement  it smacks a bit of a sneaky marketing ploy  I wouldn t mind if she was up front about the connection  Perhaps there will be an acknowledgement at the end of the third book when it comes out Still  I am enjoying the series very much and will probably listen again  now that I found out how to set my audiobook playback to FASTER  Sure wish we did not have to wait so long for the final installment  I took a flier on this book based on another reviewer  the indefatigable Charles Atkinson   and am glad I did  Penny s writing style reminds me of P D  James  about as high a compliment I can pay  The characters are wellcrafted  interesting and varied  making actual people seem like cardboard cutouts  It almost doesn t matter if nothing happens But stuff does happen  The plot is just as well crafted  and I never get the sense that things run to formula  I love a good mystery  so it s a real treat when I m both carried along with the story and surprised by each new scene If I have one criticism it s that  like James  Penny creates great suspense and anticipation and then lets the air out of the climax a little bit rather than giving the reader the full payoff of the reveal  I guess I m a sucker for the the drawing room revelation  And in fairness  she isn t quite the partypooper James is in that regard In short  I ll probably binge on every word Penny s ever scrawled until I ve plowed through the entire lot  It s that good  This book kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning  Even my husband became interested while he caught bits and pieces while I was listening  This is a Grisham book you don t want to pass on  In the 90 s I loved reading his early works The Firm  A Time to Kill  and The Pelican Brief  but slowly his books seemed to lose their luster  They ve always been enjoyable to read  but not like his early writings I fell in love with In Sycamore Row Grisham goes back to Clanton  Mississippi  the scene of A Time to Kill  and reconnects us with Jake Brigance  the struggling lawyer made famous by the Carl Lee Haley trial  His new case immediately takes on a David vs  Goliath feel which emotionally pulls the audience into the story like the best books do  The characters are very well developed  and as the story progresses it will be harder and harder to remove your headphones and rejoin the real world This book is John Grisham at his best  I will be recommending it to everyone I know  This is one of those rare times I wish audible could give me a sixstar option  I liked this audiobook as you have no idea  you have some topics that used to be too complicated for me  the grammar rules for example  after listening to this audiobook and I realized that the author has a vey good way of to give to understand  how to organize sentences  verbs  adjectives  very good  I loved it  From the time I was old enough to date  I have always struggled with relationships with the opposite sex  I was very depressed throughout my late teens and early twenties  the relationships I did have always ended because we would fight constantly or she would leave me for someone else  I am now a divorced father of two daughters  My divorce has been the driving factor for me attempting to better myself  because I realized a lot of issues in my marriage were my fault  I ve spent the past year alone working staying in the gym and focusing on bettering myself  During that time I came across Corey Wayne s videos on YouTube  His videos inspired and motivated me  Many of the things he mentioned made me realize how much I was doing wrong  I recently bought his book and completed my first readthrough  I has been a real eyeopener  I plan on reading the book again another 14 times as he s instructed  I recently met a girl that is a local celebrity in my area  She is a complete knockout  and she could have any guy that she wants  When I saw her for the first time recently  I wanted her  Fortunately  her and I went to High School together so that gave me an opportunity to open dialogue with her  I made sure to plan out how I would approach her using all of the tips used in this book  I managed to get a coffee date with her  and we ended up spending two and a half hours talking  I told her that I had a great time and appreciated her taking the time to meet me since she is a very busy person  I told her I would look forward to seeing her again  I didn t text or call her again  but the next day I was surprised when she text me and asked me what I was doing  I told her I was going to the gym  She asked me what I was doing afterwards  I told her that I was going home to eat  She invited me to come to her restaurant and said that she would cook for me  I couldn t say no  I went to the restaurant and she brought me a plate  silverware  and a drink  I don t consider myself a funny person  but I managed to joke with her a bit and we had a great conversation  She did not charge me for the meal  she walked me out to my vehicle  I told her I appreciated her making me a free meal  and I would be happy to cook for her sometime and return  we hugged and I was surprised when she nuzzled me with her head and neck  At that point I went for it  and we kissed very passionately  We ve now been dating for two weeks  and everything is great between us  However I still need to read the book many more times in order to fully grasp all of the techniques that Corey Wayne talks about  I highly recommend this book to any man that has struggled with meeting a woman and developing relationships

start off by saying it s no small feat to publish a historical novel AND get it in O s book club  I m proud of this young man as an author but I must be honest  That being said  I can t with this book    I grew up in Virginia and am very familiar with antebellum period books   as they are one of my fav s to read  I found this book underdeveloped  First the use of the the term  colored  for that time period was incorrect and it grated on my nerves the entire time I listened  Also at one point  Harriet  states that she only sticks to the areas she knows   southern shores of MD  it s a well known fact that Harriet traveled down even to the deep south to collect those in bondage  And what s up with the meeting convention in the woods where there are people promoting freelove and communism at this time period     Then they get a letter delivered to them in the middle of the woods  Sorry there were historical mistakes in this book Also to me the characters were hard to follow  the wording was flowery and really lead nowhere  I would have like to have seen a lot more cohesion of the story line  I found myself saying wth this book is all over the place  Sorry I ll be returning this one  I got to chapter 25  to give it a chance  I just can t  I don t normally write reviews but this story has left me awestruck  Dean Koontz s greatest work in my opinion  At the end you will be left with a great hope for the world and a realization of the power of connections made with others  be it humans  dogs  or any other form of life capable of love  I cant tell you how happy this book made me   it did not hit one wrong note for me  from the story line to the characters and dialogue to the performance  just so enjoyable from start to finish  I found myself smiling throughout while listening It was extra special in that I have lived in all of the locales mentioned in the story so it was so easy to immerse myself in the story  I was slightly younger than Mary Jane was in 1975 but the scenes were just so familiar Even if you didnt grow up in the 70s  the story will resonate with anybody who can still reach out and touch the memories and feelings of being an adolescent and struggling to figure out who you are  separate from your parents and having questions about growing up and sex and love but not knowing how to find the answers  I dont think there is anyone who reads this who wont wish they had a Mary Jane summer at 14 I can imagine that this will be a book I pick up again whenever I need a pick me up and a taste of nostalgia Kudos to Caitlin Kinnunen  she is awesome  After the events of the last book  Babylon s Ashes  the Expanse series was clearly building up to a crescendo and I couldn t wait to find out what was going to happen next  Tiamat s Wrath is the eighth book of the series  with only one more to follow if James S  A  Corey sticks to the current plan  and it took only a single sentence for the point to be made that this series is nearing the end  To keep things spoiler free I won t say what that sentence was  but know that this book is full of big moments and if you are a fan of the series then you will not be disappointed The crew of the Rocinante may be dispersed  but they are all playing their parts to keep humanity alive even if a myriad of other individuals seem hell bent on seeing it turn out otherwise  The story moves along from big moment to big moment and just like spending time with old friends it is over far too quickly  In contrast to the first sentence  which made it clear the series was ending  the last sentence lets you know there are still big things to come  The final book is going to be a doozy and I wish there was more than one book remaining because there is still a lot of story to tell here Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this book  I do have a couple of criticisms  First  the humor that has always been a part of this series now plays a much smaller role  and second  it felt like some of the story was a little bit contrived this time around  Both are minor criticisms and far outweighed by all the good things  so ultimately I find myself just as eager for the next book in the series as always  Jefferson Mays narrates the story once again and I will take his excellent portrayal of all these wonderful characters over the TV series any day of the week  U S Marine here  Great book  I felt as I was there with you  I felt your pain and sorrow  my war was is the desert but combat is the same  Thank you brother for sharing part of your life with us  This should be a YA book  Characters and story were very derivative so the ending was no surprise  I have been waiting for the release of this book since I finished listening to the first one I read these long ago  and it was like visiting an old friend  I now find myself waiting for the final book in this trilogy  As before  listening to it  I heard parts of the story I had forgotten or didn t remember and Victor Bevine did an excellent job keeping my ear tuned to the story no matter what I happened to be doing  These three short stories manage to do what whole books manage not to do  give you a complete story  I was drawn to this book by Molly Harper and Amanda Ronconi  one of my favorite authors and narrators  But all three stories were heartwarming a little exasperating and charming  In Suzanne Enoch s Take Two  MacCafferty was a bit of a door mat for 4 years but I liked it when he finally stood up for himself  better late than never  Eleanor was kinda of a b until MacCafferty forced her to be a grownup  In Molly Haper s Pasties and Poor Decisions  the roosters came home to roost as the saying goes  Ana lost herself and everything else after she decided that she was the only person who mattered in her life  Leaving behind all the people who truly cared about her  Ned was a great guy but hard of hearing and only hurt himself when he didn t listen or pay attention when Ana told him her plans and he just brushed her wishes aside  But coming home again everything is worked out by listening  I wish their were more consequences for Ana s daughters and her exhusband but all s well that ends well and Ana got everything she needed and more  In Karen Hawkins  Last Chance Motel a husband learns his lesson and two other wordly s give him a push in the right direction  To be fair it wasn t all Evan s fault  Jessica stopped speaking up for herself and their marriage and no matter what your face telegraphy s no one can read your mind so you must tell them what you re feeling and thinking  If you don t you can t then blame them for your life ending up in a place you never intended for it to go  With a little help they got back on track These were great stories and Amanda Ronconi was excellent in her narration  I love second chance stories  It s always nice to read when people get a doover because there are so few of those in real life  I listened to this book all night upon being notified it was available  Initially  I found it compelling and forceful in its simplicity of telling events as the author remembered them to be  The casual cruelties were shocking  both in what many of the Trump family endured and in what others in the Trump family perpetrated  Mary L  Trump utilizes her PhD well  not in bashing Donald Trump  but in explaining how and why childhood attachments are made and how they can be broken or twisted so easily by those who are supposed to love and care for them  She also explains logically how Donald Trump came to his mindset  She details his personality so exactly that it finally makes sense of what we see everyday as he performs  doesn t perform   as President  His behavior  his cruelty  his apparent disregard for all facts or of experts in various fields  his constant assertions that he knows more about whatever the subject is than anyone else  despite objective or even scientific proof that he knows next to nothing about it   his pandering to dictators and strongmen  seeking their approval in bizarre manners  and his neverending lying  makes sense Amazingly  she touches on various members of the Republican party and the staff around Donald Trump  And even though we have watched him effusively praise a person  senator or general or doctor   then discard them with vile lies and disparaging comments when they are no longer of use to him or refuse to go along with him  even when they are refusing him because that is their legal duty or factual position that will save lives  While I can say that   to me   Donald Trump sees no one as a person  but sees everyone as something to be useful to himself when their utility ends  he s happy to discard them like no longer wanted  old shoes  But it s worse  because you seldom castigate and berate old shoes  But Mary L  Trump gives a peak inside Donald Trump s mind  into his pathology  on why he is as he is  I used to think Donald Trump was evil  but now I realize that he is simply empty inside  except for a giant need for selfsatisfaction  selfaggrandizement and selfpromotion  Until now  I never realized that Donald Trump honestly doesn t realize that he is truly empty inside and has virtually no human emotions  certainly not compassion or caring  even of his own family  Donald Trump is the master of delusion  not only of himself  but of a good percentage of Americans  And he is in a constant need for a fix  like a junky  of egostroking  The most bizarre thing is that egostroking can even be accomplished   in his mind   by commentary or news that most people would find negative or abhorrent  but he finds it rewarding  as long as he is the one in the spotlight Mary L  Trump is an excellent narrator  There are no histrionics in this book  in fact  the opposite  She presents a quiet  lowkey  simple telling of the story of her life in the Trump family and what she saw happen to and by Donald Trump  Her voice is compelling  as is the book This is a fascinating book  a book I was not really thinking I would finish  Now  I am hoping she will write a sequel  expounding on Donald Trump s personality in more detail  Even if it comes out after Donald Trump s presidency is over  I would be compelled to read it  Reading this book would be great  but it wont do it justice  Listening to this story being told with the Nigerian accent and way of speaking is what gives this story LIFE  I cried  I smiled  and I was filled with joy  I vaguely remember reading the book back in the 80 s  I have seen and enjoyed the movie dozens of times but listening to the book was more fun than I anticipated  I m not a purist when it comes to adapting books to movies and I appreciated the adaptions made in the translation of this title  The movie is fabulous in it s own right but listening to the book let my imagination visually soar  Scott Brick reading was phenomenal as ever  His inflections throughout the story are spot on  I have a bad habit of gasping at exciting points in the storyline while listening to a point my husband thinks something is wrong with me  The storyline is just one entertaining wild ride  Another very much enjoyed audiobook that I would recommend  Wow  this is an awesome paranormal reverse harem romance  Cate Corvin is a gifted author  she created a fascinating and original story  the storylines  characters and world dynamics are imaginative yet realistic enough to relate to and connect with  The book grabs your attention right from the start and holds it captive straight to the end  Melisande  a fallen angel who was unjustly pushed from Heaven into Hell and she is not happy about it  Trying to pick herself up she finds her white wings are now blackened  she is also hurting and to make her day even worse she gets captured by a demon  Belial  the Prince of Wrath  Belial has plans for the fallen angel and brings her back to home  the Seventh Circle of Hell  She wants to find her way back to Heaven and Gabriel  she wants her revenge but she will have to fight her way out of Hell to get it  Melisande is on badass angel  she stands up to the best of them and even grows a fan base  She meets some interesting characters down there too  befriending Tascius  a warrior  a son of a nephilim and archangel  Lucifer takes to her as well  as does Azazel who had to make his own deal with the devil to help save his sister Vyra from him  I loved how everything plays out in this book  there is great world building and the story is cleverly plotted  There is never a dull moment with is plenty of drama  angst  thrilling and suspenseful moments  some emotional and heartfelt moments and some hot romance  I am curious to see happens next for Melissande  what will become of her and her demons and angels  Also  hints are dropped  there seems to be some sort of master plan going on  where does she and the other characters fit in  I am looking forward to finding out  hope the book comes to Audible soon  Cate Corvin  thank you for this wonderful story Sarah Puckett and Alexander Cendese are talented  top notch narrators and voice artists  They bring the characters to life  giving each their own voice and personality  as well as heart and attitude  They do an amazing job portraying the characters  Sarah Puckett truly grasped Melisandes persona  capturing her badassery to a tee  sounding just as I pictured her to sound  Alexander Cendese was awesome portraying his characters too  the alpha demons and archangels  Both are entertaining storytellers and a pleasure to listen to  Thank you for another awesome listen I got this as one of the freebies when I signed up for Audible I don t know if I would have paid for it  because I m not the biggest King fan in the world  I figured that if I didn t like it  hey  it was free It would have been worth paying retail Firstly  this is read by Stephen King himself  I cannot express how much this adds to the work  It s like sitting down at a table with Stephen King and talking to him  He may not be the best reader in the world there are several points where you can tell that he s reading from the page but the Audible rating system doesn t have an option to give 4 99999 stars This is really two short books rolled into one  The writing book is great  He covers all of the parts of writing  including the mechanics  the language  the creating  and even the marketing and selling  I am an aspiring writer  and I got more out of this than some classes and workshops  He doesn t go on forever  like a lot of blowhard writing workshops  he just makes his point and keeps going The other book is about King himself  I get the feeling that this is all we ll ever see of an autobiography of Stephen King  That part of it is not very long  and most of it is the story of his career rather than his life  As many King fans already know  he was hit by a van while he was writing this book  He talks about this experience here  I m not entirely sure I buy that the miniautobiography figures into the theme of the book  but I m not going to kvetch  It s FASCINATING  It may not have much to do with Writing  but to hear King talk about his own life and his neardeath is worth the price alone  I am a big fan of Sanderson s other works  I feel this series falls a bit flat  The story just feels too improbable and not referring to the scifi aspect Another minor annoyance  I can t hear  scud  one more time  The escalation of severity scales better with variety  not multiplicity  D to S to F gives you a better impression of a situation than  scud x 1  scud x 3  scud x 4  I d rather hear no swearing than the same singular ficticous swear over and over again  Count on Harlan Coben for believable characters  Add the way Coben spins this story out he makes the plot sound plausible The publishers summary gives a very good overview of the first half of this story which starts out in one direction  Then it changes directions a few times before you finally get to the heart of it all  Once again having almost nothing to do with what you were lead to believe in the beginning One thing I did like was next to Wilde  protagonist  the costar with chutzpah is Hester Crimstein  Shes been in a few Coben books and is a great character The ending is a real surprise that will leave you questioning some of the legalities of lawyer client confidentiality  And a few other unexpected reveals Steven Weber does a great job narrating This book has my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank You  Luke Daniels was good enough The rest was a little too woke for me  Don t know if I will be continuing the series I don t know Kevin Hearne s political views so I am assuming they are what is in the book  I don t come to fantasy to get more of the real world  I ve heard for years now about the evil  White Patriarchy  and the evils of capitalism  This coming from a white man that has become a very successful capitalist  The parts that really have me on the fence are when the book talks about how people voted for a candidate that is a monster and that those people may be monsters themselves  Then how Russia stole the U S  election and installed a puppet  It s disappointing to have more of this when I am trying to escape it by getting a good book  Kevin Hearne can write a good book  I love the Iron Druid series I can overlook a lot but I m getting tired of that narrative  Too short on substance  I felt cheated  I hope the written product is much better than this was  Not worth buying this audio version  Closet 50year oldwhitemale fan here  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because there s a little too much teenage lipmeeting  handholding and waistcaressing going on for my taste  But the overall premise and storytelling is great  I devoured the second book right after I cruised through this one  Want  Third  Book  Now  Very much enjoyed this book and the spoton language and narration  The account follows a young woman as she explores her paternal family history and locale  Living in the South  and Tennessee in particular  I could relate strongly to the quirky characters and their stories  Highly recommend if you like moderately paced  welldeveloped  and intriguing historical fiction  I am picky  and have never waited for any author to come out with a new book except for Lisa Jewell  The story is creative    and so many emotions sad  funny  intense  dark all at the same time  These narrators SO GOOD   All of them  Henrys narrator made me laugh so many times  Please    write another one soon  The narrator was great and overall  I loved it  I will be listening to it again  What did you love best about Inner Engineering  I ve been inhaling science fiction for almost 50 years  This book had several major ideas I hadn t seen before  including an interesting take on the Fermi paradox This is hard science fiction  There is a fair bit of delayed gratification where he seems to have wandered off into the weeds and you wonder what his editor was smoking  but then he comes back  taps it gently  the egg opens  and you realize that you were set up  Beautiful  I began my Mark Dawson fan girl status reading The Black Mile  I loved that story  so I searched for more Dawson books  Thats when I discovered John Milton  Beatrix and Isabella Rose  and his Other well developed supporting characters  This was five years ago Now that Ive read The House in the Woods  I discover that Ive waited five years for this story  which I didnt realize until I finished reading it  As wonderful and engaging as all of Marks books are  I have to admit that theres just that something in this style of writing that takes him one tiny notch above the rest of his excellent stories  It seems to me that this genre surfaces from somewhere deep inside his vastly creative self Atticus Priest is a layered and relatable main character  flawed in all the ways we humans are flawed  Just when I thought Id figured it out  the story turns another corner Thank you for writing this book  and I hope I dont have to wait five more years for the next one in this style  Occasionally I come across a book that is so good that I don t know if I should keep listening or turn it off for fear of finishing too quickly  This book is one of those I think that Nadia May  who narrates this and other Barbara Tuchman books  does a wonderful job  Descriptions and events are clear and largely riveting  I have only 2 complaints  One is that not all of the French is translated into English and the other is that there are no maps  I had to get my John Keegan book on the First World War and look at the maps to understand exactly what was happening  However the first complaint is problably a lack in the original printed form of the book and the second is a drawback of narrated books in general  One would hope that given the new visual capabilities of todays devices the producers would find some way to include maps I gave this book 5 stars and think it is worth every one  In my view it is better than either of the other of her books  The Proud Tower and The Distant Mirror  that I have listended to  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the events leading up to the First World War  The performance by Blair Brown was stellar I wanted badly to like this story  to enjoy it and let it swallow me up like a really great audiobook can do  I have loved other Liz Gilbert books in this way  The Signature of All Things is one of my alltime favorites  for example  and of course everyone adored Eat Pray Love  However  City of Girls left something to be desired  I think  maybe  it could have been two separate stories  instead of this long and drawn out  disjointed one  In any case  I wont stop reading your books  Liz  Anxiously awaiting whatevers next  Could barely finish this audiobook  Sometimes I laughed out loud because the situations were so cliche  Not worth the purchase  Zero mystery  all super tough characters but with a good side kind of thing  I was truly blessed and inspired by this book  I love it so much I plan to purchase a hardcopy so I can flag content that rattled my bones and made me pay attention  Great work  God Emperor of Dune compares well with the original Dune  better than the previous two sequels  Dune Messiah and Children of Dune   It doesn t quite measure up to the standard of the first book  but few books  anywhere  do Warning God Emperor of Dune is the third sequel to Dune  Ignore this book until you are familiar with Dune and the first 2 sequels It is 3500 years since Leto II Atreides donned his living sandtrout armor  Leto is now a living deity as well as galactic emperor   prescient  superintelligent  supremely strong  vengeful   and more sandworm than man  Arrakis is now lush and green the sandworms  except for Leto  are all but extinct  There is no more spice  excepting centuriesold stockpiles This is Leto s Golden Path   the future for humanity that he foresaw and planned 3500 years ago Like most of Herbert s Dune books  this book has an operatic feel   it moves slowly and most of the book is taken up with dialogue  The story really is the people  their motives and their schemes  This book revolves almost entirely around the title character  more so than the prior books   but  then  the God Emperor is the dominant story of this time and place The narration is very well done Simon Vance narrates most of the book  with Katherine Kellgren reading the occasional femaledominated chapter and Scott Brick delivering the epigraphs at the start of each chapter  Three excellent readers who did a great job  As an avid fan of The Land  and a selfstyled loyal reader to Lord Dr Aleron Kong  I like most of the community was surprised when he announced a second series set in the same universe as The Land  Again  even as a loyal reader  I  like much of his fan base  was apprehensive about Gods Eye Awakening When I discovered The Land in June 2019 I immediately fell in love with this universe  As an avid gamer and longtime fantasy reader I was impressed to find a series that combines the two  When I started reading The Land  book 7 had just come out and I was excited to find a new series that had tons of content  and even a 49 hour book I devoured The Land so naturally when Gods Eye was announced I was apprehensive that this new flashy series would detract or take away from the series I had been loyal to for a while This could not be further from the truth  Gods Eye Awakening  book 1 in the Gods Eye series  has the wonder and novelty of book 1 of The Land  whilst also possessing the vast writing knowledge and skill of book 7  This is quite literally as close to perfect as Ive seen Gods Eye takes place soon after an event in book 5 of The Land but back on Earth  You follow the path of Remy  a human dealing with his own issues and problems as he journeys to a new world and a new life Gods Eye has a darker tone than The Land but still has sufficient elements of wonder and beauty for anyone teenage or older to enjoy it  It shares similarities to the LitRPG mechanics of The Land but with awe inspiring and awesome differences  This book has some of the single coolest scenes of any Ive read and Im confident you will love it like I did Disclaimer I received this book early as a member of the AAC  advanced audio copy  team  I have not been paid or compelled in any way to write a positive review  These are my honest thoughts  Live for today  that s the ongoing theme that comes across in this story  I went into this book with the understanding that I would probably laugh a bit and cry a lot  It didn t disappoint  Vanessa and Adrian compliment each other perfectly from them moment they meet I loved the themes in this story and found it surprisingly uplifting  The dark periods and heavy content was much lighter than I had expected based on the previous two novels  especially TFZ  though to be honest that could be due to the personal connection I felt with the characters and storyline of that book   I also expected more heat than we got in this one  It was still a sweet romance with a nice wrap up  however I would have liked to see a little more sexy time details and a little less of the curtain closed post coital wrap up  I really appreciated the cameos from some well loved characters I truly enjoyed the narration in this  Christine Lakin is a new narrator to me but I m familiar with her acting work voice  She has a pleasing pace and a good register for both her female and male characters  Zachary Webber also did a great job as usual  but as a 1 click narrator for me that s to be expected   I particularly liked how he delivered the BuzzFeedesk chapter titles  Also  as expected  he was the one who made me ugly cry  He s so good at bringing on ALL the feels  but especially pain and despair Overall I was happy I picked this up  Between the story and the audio performances it s worth the credit  Definitely could be a standalone but I highly recommend reading the first 2 because they are so worth it  It was bitter sweet to hear the accounts of people chewed up and spit out by the industry I was worried that it would be to short to be useful  But it makes sense  Is to the point  and has practical examples    Now I need to apply it  But I am very satisfied with my choice so far  I have made Thich Nhat Hanh s writings and principles on mindfulness and living in the present moment a core of my life for many years  Peace Is Every Step is a life bible to me  and informs my daily living and work  So I turned to this book as a relatively recent one  and it is exquisite The key meditations  such as aimlessness  impermanence  and signlessness  are explained so well and beautifully  I sense how truly transformative each is  in terms of aging  appreciating the wonders around us  dealing with feelings of fear  understanding interbeing  and living with true joy and compassion  Life presents challenges  difficulties  and losses  yet these teachings can sustain us  help in dealing with the myriad challenges  and shape our perspectives and experiences While it contains the ideas he has shared lifelong  I always find it amazing how Thich Nhat Hanh composes and expresses these teachings in new  brilliant  and fresh ways  The prose is accessible  clear  and inspiring  In the midst of the world s turbulent times  this book brings both deep inner peace and guiding precepts for action in our daily lives  I will turn to this book again and again  Listening to Gary Zukav calmly explaining his views on spirituality  you would never guess that he was once a Green Beret serving in Vietnam and  by his own confession  a former sex addict  listen to his very honest Miboso interview at his website  www zukav com   And yet here is a man who realized that facing enemies out in the jungles of Vietnam and sleeping around with women were actually ways to avoid facing his inner enemies of fear and insecurity  Here is a man who changed from an angry soldier trained to kill into a quiet  gentle human being trained to love  Anyone who has seen him on Oprah  where he was introduced to most of us  has witnessed his gentleness and humility Gary s personal journey is an example of what he believes humanity is experiencing as a whole we are beginning to realize that controlling other people and outer circumstances cannot bring us true happiness and fulfillment  We are also beginning to acknowledge that dimensions of reality beyond the five senses exist  and that we interact with those dimensions  To sum up  we are transforming from fivesensory humans into multisensory humans   The Seat of the Soul  is a personal guide to that transformation A summary might go like this your soul picks aspects of itself that desire growth and healing  and then incarnates into a physical form having those aspects  You then draw to yourself people and experiences that awaken the unhealed parts of you and provide opportunities to consciously change your choices  When you stop making choices from fear and instead choose to act in love and trust  you experience healing and growth on your spiritual path  Paying attention to your emotions and your intuitions is very important in this process  as well as honest analysis of your intentions in every situation  And you always have help available in the form of nonphysical guides and teachers The book is wellwritten  and I found Mr  Zukav s reading to be perfect calm and clear  BUThe Dark Tower  BThe Dark Tower VII U concludes a journey that I have thoroughly enjoyed for over 15 years  The writing of this tale  which began June 19  1970  has weaved its way through Stephen King s life and all of his stories  I have never read more than a few words of this long tale  I have  whether on tape or on CD or on download from audible  listened to these wonderful stories over countless hours of my life  In that time  as did the author  I got married  have started a family have lived my life  I count none of that time as wasted and listening to BUThe Dark Tower U B was always a pleasure even the time between volumes was a pleasure as I waited once again to rejoin my old friends  With the journey at an end  I will not miss them but will continue to revisit them  as I have all these years past I invite you to begin at the beginning if you are new to the tower  as other reviews have and as the author himself has implored  In a previous review  I suggested the third volume as an alternative starting point  and I still think that a good place to start as well  as I consider UThe Waste Lands U to be the most exciting volume  It is  after all  the place where Roland s final KaTet comes together With regard to this final volume and more specifically  its narration  George Guidall comes into form  His reading of the last days of Roland s quest is impeccable in its voice and his knowledge of the characters is complete  If you begin reading this tale from the start  you will hear him in UThe Gunslinger U and  I suspect  be happy to hear his return with UWolves of the Calla U If there is anything that I could say is missing from this final tale  it is a true  Afterword  from the author but in truth  what more could he have had to say  that hasn t been said already  both in previous forwards and afterwords  as well as within the narrative itself  especially the words of this final and revealing volume  Thankee Sai King  I try very hard not to write a review till I ve listened to the whole thing  But I have to make an exception for this one  So far I ve listened to The Inferno but since I ve already read the translation itself in its entirety  I m going to stick my neck out This is brilliant  I m in Heaven  so to speak  Clive James has created an unusual but consistently effective translation rather than trying to reproduce Dante s terza rima  he plays to his own strengths by translating into quatrains  a verse form at which he is particularly adept  The result is a subtle but everpresent drumbeat of rhyme  There are better versions of individual passages in other translations  but I ve never read one where the whole thing hangs together and flows together so smoothly James also adds clarifying phrases here and there throughout the translation to reduce the need for footnotes   A good thing the printed book doesn t have any  These clarifying phrases are not as extensive as those in the Audiobook Contractors version  read by Grover Gardner but they serve the purpose  and they make it possible to listen without constantly feeling the need to look things up The result is a translation that demands to be read aloud  Edoardo Ballerini does a terrific job with the narration  capturing the Pilgrim s sense of wonder and letting the poetry unfold in its own effortless way  Ballerini is one of those narrators who conveys dialogue by suggestion rather than outright imitation of different voices  But the voices are there anyway  partly because of Dante s skill and partly because Clive James does such a good job conveying them  When passion is called for  Ballerini gives voice to passion likewise when the speaker is giving voice to shame  anger  or pride Get it  Listen to it  Enjoy it  Learn from it  Treasure it Caveat I ve read the Comedy several times  in several different translations  with several different sets of footnotes  I couldn t claim to be a master of the allusions in the poem  but I m comfortable with them   When the wind is southerly I can tell a Guelf from a Ghibelline   As such  it s hard for me to imagine the viewpoint of someone coming to this material for the first time  I THINK this would be anyone s ideal introduction to Dante  and I hope first time listeners will tackle this version and leave their reactions For myself  all I can say is that it will be a cold day in Hell  so to speak  before I reread  or relisten  to this masterpiece in any other format  There is no question in my mind that this is hands down the best audiobook version of Dante s masterpiece available  1  Live one day after another  Tomorrow s worries are for tomorrow 2  The present is all we got  it s the only time where we re in control  The past is gone and the future is unpredictable 3  Get all the facts  really understand what you re worried about  then make a call and take action 4  Get busy doing meaningful work  Fill your mind and leave no space for worrying 5  Accept the inevitable  It is so  it cannot be otherwise 5 1  When you stop fighting against the inevitable  you free yourself to focus on what really matters 6  Concern  awareness of the problem7  Worry  anxiety and loss of control8  Count your blessings  not your worries  be grateful9  You ll always have the power to get the best out of your circumstances  Always 10  Hope for the best  prepare for the worst I loved Dale s humility when he wrote that he isn t reinventing anything at all in this book  He s just giving new words to ancient wisdom  The knowledge in this book reminds me a lot of stoicism I wonder how Dale Carnegie would approach anxiety in today s society  I d definitely buy this book  I remember when I read the DaVinci Code  I couldn t put it down  And when I did  it was 4am and I was half convinced a Spanish albino monk was going to come crashing through my window Maybe it isn t fair to compare the two  but this felt lazy by comparison  It s possible I m immune at this point to the twists that Dan Brown takes the reader down  but I honestly don t think his heart was in the story  This felt more like an excruciatingly protracted science lesson than a mystery thriller I say this as a fan of Brown and as someone who will continue to read about Professor Langdon  regardless of the absurdity of his  romances  and leaps in logic  but this was the most disappointing  adventure  Langdon has embarked on  I honestly wanted to like it  but there were times in the story when I rolled my eyes so often  my wife thought that I was having stroke Return to Angels  Demons or DaVinci Code   even Inferno  but leave this on the shelf with the Lost Symbol  This book is fantastic  Its one of those books where All of the details are so vivid you can see everything the author conveying in words  Another review described as depressing but Theres absolutely nothing that left me depressed  I was fully engaged and was happy with the resolution  I finished much too fast  I highly suggest this book    narrator is spectacular  Engaging from the very start  Filled with adventure  love  lost and found  and discovering what and where home really lies  Hey laughed and cried throughout the story  One of the best Ive listened to in a while   Im a fan of Michael Lewis and his quirky and smart personality comes through as always  The book feels like he merged a couple chapters of one book with a couple chapters of another  The stories of the complete indifference and incompetence of the presidential transition quickly veered into the stories of some amazing people who work for the government  Both sides were interesting enough  however the two halves  of an already thin book  didnt meld together  A miss for me  The protagonist is an entitled narcissistic twit whom the author uses to preach to the reader about gender neutrality I urge others to save their time and money by looking for something better  Richard Dawkins is a brilliant scholar in the field of evolutionary biology  but he is neither a sociologist nor an anthropologist Like Dawkins  I do not believe in God  but in spite of this  I find his ultimate thesis lacking  He characterizes religion as a kind of memetic parasite that infected humanity long ago Now  I think a robust debate can be had as to the role of religion  if any  in modern society  but it is a bit of a stretch to suggest religion has always been a malignant memetic parasite  And Dawkins fails to provide enough convincing evidence to support such a stretch Dawkins begins this audiobook by talking about a promotional poster for a TV special on religion that he had narrated  The poster featured a New York skyline with two intact Twin Towers  The poster was captioned   Imagine a world with no Religion   This prologue Dawkins delivers betrays his ignorance It reflects a man who s thoughts on religion are not informed by a robust study of human history and culture  but merely halfbaked observations about current events Before jumping to the conclusion that  religion was the cause of 911   actual anthropologists might explore other possibilities  They might ask if the fall of the Ottoman Empire and a centuries worth of European geopolitical meddling had more to do with that unprecedented attack than an ideology that has existed in that region for 1500 years If I m being honest  though  what bothers me most about Dawkins book is the thinly veiled racism  He characterizes all religions as foolish and misguided  but he makes a point to single out Islam as particularly barbaric and incompatible with modern values  Again  he never really considers whether the violence taking place within and emanating from the Middle East has less to do with Islam  and more to do with the kind intense animosity that could result from a centurieswiorth of intercultural meddling by the Western World Stick to your lane  Richard  This book is embarrassing Narration was good  though  I almost gave up on this  The start was slow and I wasnt crazy about the interview format  I kept listening because my daughter told me it was the best book shed heard in a very long time  She is absolutely right  This book and the narrators are seriously good  I even came to appreciate the format  Its well worth a credit  Everyone will go through some kind of trial in life  but the way Lysa bares her soul and has searched for God and His goodness despite heart wrenching circumstances is inspiring  encouraging  and comforting  She has a beautiful way of communicating  and her story has resonated with me in a way I cant adequately explain  She gives tools near the end to help give hope and a tangible way of persevering in the face of uncertainty and difficult times  Can not recommend this book highly enough  So  so good  Regarding plot  this book is intricate  intriguing and excellent  I intend to work my way through the series in order  at least until I run into a narrator I truly don t like  Regarding performance  I must now eat some of my own words  My first Bosch Audible purchase was a later title read by Titus Welliver  which I enjoyed  I had passed on any read by Dick Hill because I did not like the work he did on the Jack Reacher series  Got Bosch fever and went back to the earlier titles and am glad I did  Apparently what I had not liked was the  persona  Hill gave the Reacher books  On Bosch  Hill s voice and pacing seem completely different  So I am now provisionally a Dick Hill convert  This book is more frightening than any book you ll ever read  The author makes a great case for what the future holds for us humans  I believe the concepts in  The Singularity is Near  by Ray Kurzweil are mostly spot on  but the one area Kurzweil dismisses prematurely is how the SI  superintelligent advanced artificial intelligence  entity will react to its circumstances The book doesn t really dwell much on how the SI will be created  The author mostly assumes a computer algorithm of some kind with perhaps human brain enhancements  If you reject such an SI entity prima facie this book is not for you  since the book mostly deals with assuming such a recursive self aware and self improving entity will be in humanities future The author makes some incredibly good points  He mostly hypothesizes that the SI entity will be a singleton and not allow others of its kind to be created independently and will happen on a much faster timeline after certain milestones are fulfilled The book points out how hard it is to put safeguards into a procedure to guard against unintended consequences  For example  making  the greater good for the greatest many  the final goal can lead to unintended consequence such as allowing a Nazi ruled world  he doesn t give that example directly in the book  and I borrow it from Karl Popper who gave it as a refutation for John Stuart Mill s utilitarian philosophy   If the goal is to make us all smile  the SI entity might make brain probes that force us to smile  There is no easy end goal specifiable without unintended consequences This kind of thinking within the book is another reason I can recommend the book  As I was listening  I realized that all the ways we try to motivate or control an SI entity to be moral can also be applied to us humans in order to make us moral to  Morality is hard both for us humans and for future SI entities There s a movie from the early 70s called  Colossus The Forbin Project   it really is a template for this book  and I would recommend watching the movie before reading this book I just recently listened to the book   Our Final Invention  by James Barrat  That book covers the same material that is presented in this book  This book is much better even though they overlap very much  The reason why is this author  Nick Bostrom  is a philosopher and knows how to lay out his premises in such a way that the story he is telling is consistent  coherent  and gives a narrative to tie the pieces together  even if the narrative will scare the daylights out of the listener  This author has really thought about the problems inherent in an SI entity  and this book will be a template for almost all future books on this subject  I dont venture into the spy genre often  I started this on a whim  enjoyed it for the first few nights I listened to it and then on the third night found myself at 4am still going  unable to sleep  its that tense  It also usefully filled in some holes in my British history  Thank you  a great listen  You will not find a book smarter than this one to lead you to a healthier lifestyle Shawn keeps it real  takes off the kid gloves and delivers the research that holds the truth Eat Smarter is NOT delivering a quick fix   they dont work yall   you have to actually DO the work And the work is eating better quality food You do NOT have to have any background in nutrition to understand the content happening between the front and back cover   Shawn makes it very palatable and easily digestible  He even gives you a 30 day CUSTOMIZABLE plan to get you started If your overall goal is better health  this is the guide for you because it will sustain you for a lifetime    WOW  just wow  where to begin First of all it s over   WHEN is the next one coming out  because I will be hoovering that one too So  first thought about Magical Midlife Madness is holy cats it is hilarious   So many times I laughed out loud and caused side eyes from my husband and my kids  At one point I was laughing so hard I was crying and crossing my legs so I wouldn t piddle myself Second thought is that it is an amazing story  I love how powerful the main character is  She might second guess herself here and there  but she knows who she is  and she is amazing Thirdly  Niamh is hilarious  And the play between Mr  Tom  Niamh  and Edgar is extremely awesome hilarious sweet All that being said I LOVED this book  I would recommend to anyone  and cannot wait for the next book   The story was interesting and it has a great  hook  to bring you into the storyline rather quickly  however the book falls short toward the end  Now the problem could be me   in that this appears to be an  episode  rather than an a stand alone novel  I only listen to audiobooks  so it may very well be classified as a novella or a multipart book Given that it costs me 1 credit for only a little over 3 hours of listening I don t think I will be continuing on with the other episodes  The story and performance just don t seem worth the time money when I could spend that same credit on 11 hours of some riveting story  Beautiful world building Beautiful detailing but     the story itself  I expected more I m just kind of not impressed  Especially with how much hype I was hearing about this book  There is like one and a half action scenes  The flash backs were more interesting than the main character BUT with the final word in this book she got my interest  because now I need to know how  This book had me from the very first words uttered  Loved everything about the story  the characters  But the author sure did leave a lot to be desired with that ending    or lack thereof  Those of us who read these kind of stories like endings  whether it be happy or sad  we need want to know what happens  I  for one  dont like being left hanging like this  unless its part of a series  which I dont think this is   Good book but just beware there is NO ending  I watched the Netflix movie before reading the book as it was not in available in English  I have to say the movie was way better than the book and thats not saying much  It feels as if the book is moving so fast with very little detail of the characters  He sees her in a dream and then he kidnaps her and then she falls for him in the first TWO hours of the book   Nah  The only saving grace is the narrators  They did a great job although I thought they were supposed to have accents  I wouldnt recommend  Just watch the movie    This book has it all  Excellent writing  well developed characters  exciting plot  and oh the twists and turns  If you like twisty mysteries but are burnt out on the puppy mill of garbage on the market as of late  this book is for you  I read several audiobooks a week and have a library of thousands  This is easily my favorite book this year  Im surprised there isnt more buzz around it  The narrator is fabulous  She sort of reminds me of Julia Whelanwhich is some of the highest praise I can bestow on a narrator  I loved this book and was entertained by it  however  it feels like this series has lost direction and purpose  all it is now is main character trying to live life rather than having an overarching goal  it was also hard to relate to the book for me  the character made many questionable decitions that don t seem consistent with his personality  spoiler  like saving a moral enemy  Its hard to leave a review on a politicallycharged book without getting political  but I will do my best  So  here goesWhat I liked most about this one is how Shapiro tactfully diagnoses the current state of the country as well as the dangerous ideologies that have brought us to such a place  Without the belief that America is and always has been an evil place  he says  we would not see such widespread prevalence of cancel culture  tribalism  and a desire to dismantle the system from top to bottom Another thing I really enjoyed about this one was Shapiros ability to have a reasonable discussion about the history of America  He does not deny the atrocities that have taken place in our country  nor does he suggest that we should attempt to look past them Instead  he says  we should use such lessons to help us guide our future behavior  come together  and reinforce the rights outlined in the constitution  When we dont do those things  we allow such atrocities to take place  and we grow further divided by the day Shapiros willingness to actually discuss difficult issues  in my opinion  is what makes him an effective political commentator  He even says  when talking about cancel culture  that the proper response to someone you disagree with is to have a discussion  Yet  in America these days  it seems like all we want to do instead is flip the middle finger  the proper response if we want to silence someone Thus  he concludes the book by saying that if we want to repair the rifts in our country  we need to stop silencing one another and come together  We need to talk more and attack less  And  most importantly  we need to see the good in others  learn to trust one another again  and unite  Its an important message delivered at a critical time  and regardless of political affiliation  its why I recommend this book Brian SachettaAuthor of Get Out of Your Head When these two talented authors put their heads together and collaborate on a romance you know its going to be good  you know youre going to meet some charming loveable characters and you know that the path to happily ever after may take a wee bit of time   but the journey will be a sweet ride  Well  Molly and Declans story was all that   and so so much more as they roommated  friend zoned yet gravitated towards each other and took some wrong steps along the way  However  love conquers all in the end and Declans anxieties over his bouts of depression  Mollys meander down the wrong path and them living in very different Zip Codes all got sorted out in the end  Their roundabout journey into each others arms was wonderfully entertaining as it has delicious feels of anticipation which grew and grew as they analyzed their true feelings  And even Mollys journey back to her onceestranged dying father was heartwarming  held a poignant meaningful message to us all and was so very bittersweet and beautiful Worth a credit  Yes absolutely  it was a slowbuild of a story about recognizing love   about taking chances   about following your heart   and about eventual happily ever afters  And Molly and Declans wellpaced journey came from the mighty minds of Ms Ward and Ms Keeland   two gifted authors who excelled  captured the warmth  the humor  the conflict of heart  the tortured dilemmas  the fatherdaughter bond   and described love   love   love  And Erin and Sebastian brought their A game  breathed life into the characters and turned this impressive dual POV tale into an awesome audiobook  I expected a light historical romance  and this novel did deliver on that expectation  But it also offered a full throated declaration of love for books  reading  and libraries  As the daughter of a librarian  I found it very comforting to remember that the people who stand up for the right to access all kinds of information are heroes  I really loved the story that revolved around a widow princess  lost prince and faithless priest All who demonstrate the will to change and be changed in order to bring the tale to a compelling end  The voiced pacing was a little slow for me in the beginning but it grew on me and I appreciated the talent with which the story was read  I loved this book  it really surprised me  it starts slowly but the mystery of where it is headed and how grabs you and before long it is rolling along  The fantasy elements are written so subtly and fluidly as part of the story that I didn t feel like I was reading a  fantasy  or  magic  book  it is more like the lives it describes  intertwined and part of each other  Though it is a translation I found the writing lyrical and almost like poetry at times  just beautiful  There are wonderful moments but be warned  this story is more about heart breaks and how we keep living despite them rather than about lives filled with joy  There is reconciliation and joy  though  The narrators were wonderful  rhythm  pace and accents spot on with the tone of the story  What made the experience of listening to Pet Sematary the most enjoyable  I listened to the first 3 Drizzt books  And now I am glad to find this new series that carries on his adventures with other heroic characters  I ignored these books back when I used to actually read scifi fantasy  now I wish I hadn t  excellent yarns  And by far  Bevine is the best narrator for the genre  not a fault can be found  clear  good tone  his voice adds enthusiasm and excitement during exciting scenes  he does enough voice imitation for different characters to make it clear who is talking  but not corny either  And of course  the story was very good  else I wouldn t give it 5 stars  Highly recommended  Plenty of reviews will tell you about the wonderful story  This performance is full cast audio  I feel like the mixing was off though  Some voices are very clear  but the voice of the narrator  Phillip Pullman  is oddly   muffled  It s fine to listen to while going for a walk or doing quiet things at home  It s often quite difficult to follow while in the car though  His voice  or the mixing thereof  just doesn t work well with road noise even in a relatively quiet car  Just a note for those who are looking for things to while away the long drives  I have read a lot of American history  I found this book fascinating and enjoyable  Most notably to see that bad times are nothing new  that there have been worse times than the present  Also to see that we as a country and our leaders at the top can chose to follow our better or our worse angels  And that there will never be a time that both wont be present  Well done  This has always been my favourite novel from the Vampire Chronicles series  even though Interview with the Vampire is more popular  but I ve always held off downloading it from Audible because it was only available abridged  aka butchered  but when this edition became available I downloaded this  Interview and Queen of the Damned immediately I ve read the paperback edition of this book many times but Simon Vance narrates very well and captures the cheeky  elegant character of Lestat very well and brings out some subtleties that I ve missed before This novel stands alone very well if you haven t read the other Anne Rice books since it only makes a few references to Interview with the Vampire I hope Audible will release more unabridged Anne Rice books  The Mayfair Witch novels    Gregg Hurwitz has done it again  I wasnt sure if he would be able to come up with a storyline that could top or at least equal the intensity of his previous book  He has The publishers summary gives a very good comprehensive overview so o dont want to expound on the story itself What I will say it that this is a very well written book  It has a very intricate plot with a few subplots  The amount of detail combined with the vivid descriptions makes this a hard book to put down Anyway  trying not to give anything away but this book has a great ending and a surprising cliffhanger  I almost thought this series was wrapping up until the last line  Cant wait for the next Scott Brick does a wonderful job narrating as always This book has my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank You  This book is a great continuation of the series  Great magic system  The MC isn t over or under powered  It actually delves a little into the history of his grandfather which was sorely needed  The narrator is excellent   Just go ahead and buy this one if you liked the first  And I ll never be one  But  I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this book  Loved hearing the history  And chia seeds have become a routine part of my diet  Educational without being stuffy  Loved this book  After looking for something similar to the Black Dagger Brotherhood  Midnight Breed  or basically what I now found to be called paranormal romance I settled upon the Immortal Guardian Series  This book is intelligently written with a strong female character  Sarah  discovering her knight in shining armor or rather her knight in a tanned ripped body  Roland  Normally  I listen while commuting but I could not set down the iPod and go back to normal life  I went looking for medial tasks so I could listen to more  Well now the house is sparkling and I have completed one of the most breathtaking audible books  This was a fun action packed book  It was a good listen for some long walks  This incredibly wellproduced and narrated audio version of a literary masterpiece is going into my top 10  The story is gruesome and attentiongrabbing but the real beauty is in the exploration of every person involved  as well as all of the events leading up to  and following the crime  This one had me riveted enough to leave the TV off for just a little bit longer so I could finish listening to one more chapter  that is extremely rare for me  My opinion is 5 stars without a doubt  Ken Follett never fails to entertain  and though this is not his best book it s got that  Can t stop listening  got to find out what happens next  quality that is the mark of a natural storyteller  I waffled between three and four stars  and decided on four because of that very quality  As always Follett introduces numerous engrossing if twodimensional characters  he s great with his villains  the story moves at a great clip  The book is predictable  but still a fun read  almost a guilty pleasure  The story is comparable to what the disciples faced in Acts when confronting the religious leaders with the truth of Jesus Christ  So  in that aspect  I liked it very much  However  Ted gets a little carried away with implying that government and laws only exist out of fear  He implies that those who break laws should not be punished because that isn t  love   As usual  Ted takes his desire to emphasize the importance of love over religion a tad too far  But overall it was a gripping story with some good supernatural elements and a narrator I could listen to forever  This book is the 6th in the Orphan X series  I had such a great time listening to this book  Once I turned it on I couldnt stop and I so sorry to say Im finished  Hurwitz does a great job filling in history without sounding repetitive for anyone who has not read the previous books  I would suggest listening to the series in order  Its worth your time  Scott Brick narrates all and does a superb job  His talent increases the level of drama and suspense At the end of the last book Evans mother called  He never knew her  The revelations are plenty and Evan learns much about her and why he was given up as an infant  But theres more history that is filled in Candy  a character from previous books and fellow orphan also makes an appearance  Evan is involved in an extremely dangerous operation and calls her for assistance  Kind of ironic if youre familiar with how they met The publishers summary gives more than enough accurate information so I wont add to that as I dont want to give any spoilers The story ends with a cliffhanger and I wish I didnt have to wait so long for the next in the series This book has my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION If you found this review helpful please indicate so Thank You  The 0 0082 Business by David MacDean was completely not what I was expecting  as other reviewers have mentioned as well  I was also expecting a business book but was pleasantly surprised when Mr  MacDean started his tale of getting into windowwashing  He wrote this book of his experiences with candor  humor  and nuggets of great  actionable tidbits for those out there that are looking to start their own small business  I really enjoyed listening to his story Mr  MacDean has a great reading voice  though be prepared  as he is Scottish  I didn t have a problem listening to his narration  but some that have trouble with accents may  I d recommend listening to the sample first  My reason for the fourstar review on narration is simply because the audio recording is pretty poor  It sounds tinny and listening to that for any amount of time is going to being on a migraine in migraine sufferers  That being said  I had to listen in short spurts  I would recommend getting some better audio recording equipment in the future  I was voluntarily provided this free review copy audiobook by the author  narrator  or publisher for an honest review Did you find this review helpful  If so  would you please take a moment and select the  helpful  button below  Thanks so much  I loved this book  I was looking for something light after finishing a dark book and this did not disappoint  This book literally had me laughing out loud  I really enjoyed the character of Tia and found her relatable  probably because I m a bit crazy myself   Tia s journey to meet her number one crush kept me engaged the entire time  I also grew to really like some of the supporting characters  I d love a spin off   The performance was great and Grace Grant did a fabulous job bringing Tia to life  I hope more books from this author make their way to audio  Narrator is fantastic The book is entertaining  but peddles dangerous climate change denying rhetoric that serves to dilute an important topic  Also makes fun of anything that offends the authors libertarian sensibilities As a Norwegian living in a thriving socialist democracy  I just had to stop reading it halfway through because the astounding pettiness of the rhetoric just made me uncomfortable If this book hadn t been trying so hard to take part in a political conversation  it probably would ve been quite good  I bought this book in a batch purchase of business books  I was looking for inspirations  ideas  To be honest  I got sucked in by the title  thinking it was a business book  Its a biography Overall  there were some small learning moments for me  but most of my experience with this book felt like a man politely boasting of his very successful career At first  I was discouraged by the amount of biography over business ideas  However  when I did a little homework on the book  I realized it was more of a bio so I adjusted my expectations  Then the book teased me with business  nuggets  admidst all of the stories  I say  teased  because a chapter will start off by telling a story that feels like a backdrop for a good business lesson  However  instead of pointing out how his struggles  successes can apply to you and me  the chapter would just end with an      and that s how I was successful with that business   Thomas is quite the narrator  Humorous and keeps you engaged  Had a Fun time listening  This is a great look back at interesting characters and events in British history  The author s dry wit makes this particularly entertaining  It s very much in the vein of his youtube channel  Thoughty2  which I also highly recommend   This is a really excellent book with a lot of helpful information on personality profiling  The one detractor from the audio version is the absence of the actual personality test which is crucial to understanding the content  That being said  read his original work on raising children prior to adolescence and then read this work  This one is a bit of a slow read initially  He takes a good amount of time to details key issues of adolescence and helping parents consider options toward remedy options  That part is a bit dry but get past that and the book becomes alive again I recommend parents of teens and maybe better parents of preteens to read this book in full  Should a reader choose to take action with any tips there will be need for some homework to get things together  For example  a contract for disciplinary options agreed upon by both the parent s  and the adolescent  All in all the book is good and I recommend it  Just be prepared for some of the more dry sections in the middle  The first book in the series  half way through  I couldn t get into it  I actually returned it  the laying in bed I could not stop thinking about it  the different possibilities and scenarios that could happen  I redownload it  and am so glad I did  this series sparks All emotions  So well written and as always Emma Galvon is amazing  adding life to words  from the 2nd half of the 1st  to the last word of the 4th  I ve never been so happy to have so much work to do that gave me the opportunity to listen so many hours in a row  3 days I listened to All I Liked the way these tales make you think  A good book for teaching or for a club to read and discusses  This is the most hasslefree way I ve found to effectively refresh my Spanish skills  I listened to this book while doing housework  just as I would with any other audiobook  and with my attention partly on chores I was still able to both follow the story and gain exposure to a lot of helpful new vocabulary The title describes this book as  10 short stories   but it s actually one continuous story divided into ten chapters  That s good  because the continuity helps keep you listening  Each chapter concludes with a supplemental section that summarizes what s just happened  both in Spanish and English  then drills several dozen vocabulary words from the story  and finally asks a few multiplechoice reading comprehension questions  This is a solid formula for strengthening your skills  and it helps that the story  which is about an American student traveling for the first time in Latin America  is cute and easy to listen to What makes this book a standout though is the narrator  Mariela Arredondo is seriously A  both as a language teacher and storyteller  Right from the introduction  a section that tends to be filler in most languagelearning recordings  Mariela s warmth and energetic delivery is a welcome surprise that didn t even once tempt me to use the skip button  Her advice and encouragement will  I daresay  actually leave you feeling welladvised and encouraged  Even better  she s a great performer  Her expressive voice makes it easy to tell apart the different characters and their emotions  which both aids comprehension and breathes no small amount of life into the material The clarity of Mariela s delivery also means you can get the most bang for your buck by increasing the speed of the audio on repeat listens  The crystal clear pronunciation won t get muddled if you raise the tempo  and that makes this book a great practice tool for learning how to follow speedy Spanish speakers  It also makes the vocabulary sections doubly valuable  I found these sections to be way less boring than the drills in other language learning tapes  because they reinforce words you already have memorable context for from the story  The vocab sections also give you time to focus on Mariela s model pronunciation  and finetune your own I took Spanish in grade school for years  and since then I ve made countless earnest  but shortlived  attempts to improve  If you ve tried to read novels in Spanish  get through languagelearning tapes  watch telenovelas for more than the unintentional comedy and so on  first of all  high five  and second  consider giving this book a try  With minimal commitment  it gets you back into the swing of learning and  just as importantly  it paves the way toward being able to confidently read or listen to your own choice of material in Spanish I was given this free review copy audiobook at my request  and have voluntarily left this review  I have some experience in living this lifestyle To have read this book years ago could have benefited me a great deal Just the same  no matter where youre at in life  whether youre a seasoned investor or investing is something that seems out of reach for you today  go ahead and start reading this book now  I have gorged myself on business books in the last year  This was hands down one of the best  It applies to many areas of life even outside the office  From the newest  rookie  at a company to the CEO  this has countless rules which can be absorbed and used the moment they are learned  No one argues that Disney has phenomenal customer service  This is a great guide  from an authoritative source on how to relate those practices to your own business and the benefits they will reap  The book describes diet and offensive meds and other practices that are toxic to fatty liver  I found that I was doing good my diet but room for improvement  Good book  This is by far the most perfect and easily accessible book about life and spiritual truths I have ever read  A book full of the truths for the times we are inright on time  A book so full of wisdom and love that after each chapter I feel more in love with life and myself and feel the love from the universe  Matts voice is soft and clear and his personal stories are a tangible connection to a man I trust  I too have felt the way he describes his own pain and Matt being a few steps ahead to help guide is a gift to humanity  I will get the audible subscription just to hear this book as much as I want  I also bought the book and decorated the front cover how I creatively felt inspired  to make it mine  to keep by my bedside for a long long time  Enjoy  As the author takes us thru storytelling in a reader centered way I found myself looking forward to each new chapter and what I would learn and could implement into my business I use this book as my daily Spanish listening exercise  This is an excellent book for beginners the stories are familiar and interesting  and the narrators voice is clear and easy to understand  It is a very helpful way to learn Spanish  I highly recommend this book  I didnt think it would have much to offer since I had already read Radical Remissions but every detail and story in this book brings it home just as much and I learned new things with this one as well  I highly recommend both books  Great teaching  Very helpful  Every believer should read listen to this book  we need the power of God working in us in every day situations  To change our world  If you ever been to Istanbul or if you have longed to visit  you won t be able to meet a set of friends like these and fully experience the complex bubbling energy that emerges within this novel  It is as rich as a cup of Turkish coffee after a spicy dinner  The flavors blend but maintain their individual identities Everything I say could be a spoiler or superficial about these 5 individuals  their past stories as well as their present lives of survival on the streets of Istanbul  You will find humor  rascally misadventure  joy  tragedy  and most of all humanity in these lives I love the way the pacing accelerates when Nalan takes the wheel  The ending is really great so leap in and enjoy  So yes  I am going to leave a review  because a book like this can get noticed  for sure First of all  I loved the stories  every one of them  And yes  some were VERY different from others  The cover shows the one about the uhm    is that the witch or the werewolf girl  Probably the werewolf girl  Yes  that one caught me by surprise  I didn t see it coming  and no  I m not going to spoil it for you  You ll never guess who the real werewolf is  Or maybe you will  I don t know that either The one about the witch and the beauty potion was funny  It made me think too  since there is so much power in beauty Another story that caught my attention  was the one about the criminal who quit  It sounded a little too easy to me  and in reality  it might be more complicated  But again  as Rachel Swenson seems to do  there was a lot of simple humor in it None of these stories had a lot of blood and gore  if any  I think that s another reason why I enjoyed them  It was all about the mystery  the magic  or the puzzle  So yeah  very good  The narrator did great too  and made every story a lot better because of his enthusiasm  If you could sum up Science Set Free in three words  what would they be  God did it again  Another magnificent book by Joel Osteen  It is clear that God is using Joel Osteen to give us a message of hope and freedom to know that we are loved by God Almighty and God wants us to love ourselves the same way he loves us  I truly enjoyed this book  Having spent about two years working on my own theraputic journey and having tried to seek couples therapy with an ex  I truly appreciate just about everything I heard in this book  I found it to be easy to listen to  despite some emotionally challenging content  because the author seems very genuine  honest  down to earth  humble and has a pleasant sense of humor  I found much of this book and the autgors presence to be relatable  The Gottman s approach seems very respecful  I can t help but wonder what my couples therapy experience would have been like with them and if it would have changed things or the outcome with my ex  I read several books by John Madinna  This book is as other books  realistic  proved with scientific evidence and full of life situations  I am specialized in cognitive neuroscience and I can borrow the books method of simplifying aspects to teach my students  It is full of information that could have been heavy and jargons if explained with different words  However  the author made our life easy with his explanations and real stories  I always write notes from his books and refer to them  After an hour of exercising in the gym  I can go home and recall what I have heard and scratch this information for future recall  I am amazing how clear and organized this book is  I can vividly recall what I have heard  I have already recommended this book for many of my friends and members of family  n Vision Driven Leader  Michael Hyatt lays out the importance of vision to your organization and then lays out a process for how to create and implement a clear vision in your business or organization As a staff pastor in a large church  it is easy to focus exclusively on the next task  Often  these tasks can become silos  You will string one thing to the next and you will eventually arrive somewhere  or maybe you wont  Who knows  This is an uninspiring picture but it tends to more or less be my reality Through Vision Driven Leader  I have seen the importance of envisioning my destination  In addition to this  I have had a path laid before me of how to craft and script my vision  the book focuses on writing your vision script    The great things about all of a Michael Hyatts books persist here  It is a short read without nonsense and fluff  The audio book is right around 4 5 hours It packs a punch and words arent wasted  Additionally  Hyatt expertly lays out a path for those who have no idea what they are doing  He did this for me in Free to Focus and Your World Class Executive Assistant and he continues the streak in this text  I not only know what I should do  I know HOW to do it  Hyatts conversational style and engaging anecdotes help this book strike balance between helpful and challenging You should read this book if you look at your organization and have a sinking feeling it could be better and that you could get it there  This book will help you pave the road to your vision and make you a more effective leader I thought it was suppose to be about friendship but it was just an autobiography  Not a great one at that  If you don t move to LA to be a big famous somebody  then you re not doing it right  She pats herself on the back for this continually  I m sure she s nice  just don t think she s a great writer or influential  But I m a happy in my small town nobody   so maybe I just don t get it  lol Very basic  easy to listen to story  a bit predictable at times  but well worth the listen  A great book to give yourself an attitude check and remember why and how attitude matters  I will keep the rules where I can see them for sure  I know you are gone but your words and your voice always bring me inner peace  You are in a better place  I thank you for leaving behind your lessons  Beautiful book  Ray and Jessica Higdon are powerhouses in the network marketing training arena and their teachings have made a huge  positive impact in the way i run my homebased business this book takes their trainings even further  allowing their proven concepts to be applied to any entrepreneurial endeavor  allowing people to create something of their own in any industry and see RESULTS based on their efforts the best part of the book is that its filled with simpletoimplement action steps that  if followed  will lead to certain success  I could not listen to it all because the narrator has loud exhales and inhale the whole time  This is completely unlistenable  Lots of hot stories here of all sorts of kinks and erotica  Recommended  Very good narration  No matter where I pick up in the book  it has just the right story or lesson for me  I ve recommended this book many times Many stories of people stuck in one unhappy or unhealthy mindset that get freed up by small changes anyone can make  James and Shoshana plant many seeds of possibility for joy that begin to bloom in people s lives  Their voices are very calming yet assertive  I LOVE this book  I probably would have bought the Kindle edition of this book  but one isn t available  I was very excited to get the material quickly  so I went for the audiobook  But  I ended up ordering the print version after listening to just a few chapters  The book is valuable  but it s a reference  that s nearly impossible to use to  refer  to in audio form  Why this book did not come with a supplemental PDF  I have no idea But there s a couple other issue that made this book less than pleasant to listen to  First  the book is just jampacked full of numbered lists  usually of things to do to help your brain  and long sections that describe various types of addicts  In print  you d see numbers  bold  headings  indentations  etc to help you understand where you were within that material  Hearing this information read  it was very hard for me to keep an overview of where I was  It became really mindnumbing  Perhaps I will think twice next time  before purchasing this type of book in audio form Secondly  unfortunately this book is  extremely  repetitive  The information is valuable  but he repeats the same info over and over in every chapter  Perhaps he wrote it thinking people may flip straight to one chapter  and he wanted people to be able to just read that one chapter and get the info they need But if you listen to the whole book  it s frankly boring  and you wish he d stop telling you the same things to do over and over  I started to feel like a lot of this book was actually filler   Here s how to implement the same suggestions at home with your family    Here s how to implement the same suggestions with your kids    Here s how to implement the same suggestions at your workplace    Here s how to implement the same suggestions in your own treatment program  Here s how he could have organized the book better  He could have had a chapter on each brain type and the supplements and treatments specific to that type  Then you d have ALL the info on that brain type together in one place  and he could have described the program for that brain type succinctly Instead  he made his program seem like MORE work than it actually is by the way he presented it  He repeated the same suggestions over and over throughout  He gave list after list of hundreds of  to dos  throughout the book  But most of them were the same from chapter to chapter  Not helpful psychologically  would have been so much better for him to just summarize all the steps in one place What I did like about the book was information on supplements  which should have been expanded into its own chapter   and the 4pronged approach they take towards addiction treatment of 6 types of addicts  Despite everything I said above  the book is great info  If you get it in print form  you ll avoid the annoyances of having to listen to it  Or  at least buy a cheap used copy to refer to  My daughter and I listened to this book on the way to college It is the perfect length and the content is rich  Im very hopeful that listening and talking about these things will help her have more confidence heading into her first year  Highly Recommend  Loved this audible book  I took my time with it by listening to each chapter twice  and making the summaries the second time listening  The aim is not to get through the book quickly  but to really apply each chapter Im now listening to the book for the second time and adding to my summaries and information recorded  I have read many relationship books  but this has been the best so far  Many of us need to stop overanalyzing men  just enjoy the relationship  This is a fascinating topic  written by a great scholar in the subject matter  Unfortunately  the narrator frequently refers to graphs and studies that are presumably shown and or are sourced in footnotes  Unlike with other Audible titles  there does not appear to be a companion pdf for this book  This book is a plethora of knowledge  I enjoyed every minute  At the end of each chapter there are verses for meditation  questions to consider  and a prompt to write out a prayer  What a beautifully read book  There is so much depth and wisdom that I m sure I will listen to it many more times  The author does an exceptional job of making a complex subject understandable  It was enlightening  I have three daughters age 12  and twins girls who are 8  So much wisdom I got through hearing this book   Thank you so much Kari the Holy Spirit was with you through writing this book and definitely touched my heart in so many ways  I will keep going back to this book over and over  Id recommend this to all men and women  especially those who struggle with hearing God or lack wisdom in knowing what or how to pray  Sometimes women forget how much power we possess and this book is a great reminder of that and how to use it YOU ARE STRONGER AND MORE THAN YOU THINK  First of all  the first 50 minutes of this is literally reviews of other books  Why  Also  I got to story five but had to stop as none of them have been worth my time  Lastly  the male narrator has a voice that grates on my nerves and that with everything else really ruined this for me  Overall This book hit the bullseye with me  I do some kind of meditation every day   though I often wonder as in the Randy Newman song  Maybe Im doing it wrong  Still  Im mindfull of the positive difference in my life when I take the time  Dans 10 Happier book and app helped set the stage for what has become one of my best habits  That stage being set  this latest book is like acting class Performance These guys are pros  It is excellent  as expected  It flows like a conversation Story Pay attention to the title  This book is intended for fidgety skeptics  if that isnt you  then you may not relate the the story which is essentially that of Dan Harriss epistemic exploration of mindfulness meditataion as it relates to himself  The good news for me is  it checks most of my boxes  too  If the title fits you  then dive in  and dont forget to check out the app  A great and unique read for the genre  Harriss skepticism and occasional acerbic humor makes this meditation book different from most  Its also a narrative  and an adventure Everybodys experience in approaching and practicing meditation is unique  However  I think most readers will find a connection with Harriss personal journey and will profit in their own practice  I personally really enjoyed it and have listened to this audiobooks three times in as many years The last hour of this version of the audio book contains guided meditations  This is an absolute must read or listen to  Pretend your life depends on it  I have been a fan of Mark Kurlansky for many years but this is the first audio book I ve experienced  Brian Sutherland s narration is a colorless monotone which leads me to believe that he was thoroughly bored by the topic  With a different narrator  Milk  would have been a thrilling history but Sutherland makes it as interesting as reading a telephone directory  What a shame  If you want to grow your business with social media this is the book for you  The author does an awesome job laying out steps you should follow to climb your way up the ladder to success  Nowadays most businesses advertise  build their brand on social media platforms one of the big ones being Instagram so it is definitely essential to learn how it works especially from someone who has been in those shoes before  you can also use this information on other platforms  The way he lays out the information in each chapter is very simple to follow anyone can understand it  It is a great book to get your foot in the door of growing your business and getting some good insight on your business journey  This book gave me the motivation and knowledge to work smarter on my own site  Furthermore  Ronald Roberts gives you a plan of attack to take your blog to the next level  I highly recommend it  4 50 Stars for me This was a good and solid ending to the series  Single dad and single mom plus a middle child with a huge chip on his shoulder  Add in some bad people and a new couple trying to make time for each other and you have a recipe for a good story and Freya delivered One of the things that I enjoyed about this series was that the MCs were not only older but acted their age  I am not sure why so many authors think that every man wants to kill any other man that looks in the direction of their woman or that every time they have sex  it is always the best ever  Us guys are human  have self control  after we turn 21  and sadly need time to recharge  Overall I really like the book   easy to follow and very good voice quality that didnt make you sleepy  My only complaint is the PDF file is not attached which have the much needed grocery list to assist in getting off to a great start  Please correct this because it was referred to inside of the book many times and this will definitely assist your readers in being successful with the cleanse  Overall  great information  Cosmic Journey is an easy goto for mindfulness  I like it very much  thank you author for the job well done  It is normal to feel emotional during pregnancy  This audiobook program is the perfect tool for any pregnant woman to feel more mindful and find their inner peace during pregnancy  Highly recommend it  you don t have to have different techniques for different rooms so it gets repetitive  keep it short and it will be more interesting What did you love best about 10Minute Digital Declutter  It was exactly and precisely what I was looking for but in a much more understandable format than what I had expected  The idea is that if you have a System and you believe in that System  it should not be time consuming to actually use it  This book lays out that System in an easily understood manner  The narrator did a great job  I actually got the kindle version and the Audible version to maximize my understanding and absorption of the System so I had the Audible running while I read the Kindle version  That worked brilliantly  I read very slowly in spite of having an MBA and so I have to spend more than the usual amount of time reading books        and this worked for me  just perfectly  This is a really great book for beginners and moderately knowledgeable investors  It really hammers home compounding returns  Good case studies  What made the experience of listening to 100 Cupboards the most enjoyable  Great book Good jokes  Two thumbs UP  Enjoyable story  Clever interesting charcters journey   i left my real legs at home  I had hoped that this book would be a  kick in the pants   and really challenge me  I m finding it watered down and too elementary  I don t plan on finishing it  It would probably make a good devotional for a high school or college student  I will listen to this again and again  Makes perfect sense when it comes to relationships    Loved it  It was enlightening  The information in the book is excellent  Anyone should be better prepared for a disaster or crisis situation after hearing this information  However  id strongly recommend getting the paperback or kindle edition  This book has many useful  detailed  and in some cases necessary illustrations for mastering these skills  The narrator is awsome and really paints a picture and emotion  the book itself was amazing and I would recommend this to anyone pursuing Entrepeneurship  I listened to this on my way to work and traveling home or to clients  it really gets you going to push harder  Very well organized book  Simple approach to pushing out a lot of excellent information  As a heavier user of audiobooks  Its important for authors voice to read it  I have marked a number of key rules and took quite a few notes  This book is basically like a quick summary of her first book only stating the main parenting strategies of the first  An enjoyable collection of poems but I preferred the Poets Corner collection by Lithgow with its mini summary of each poet and poem to give context  100 Side Hustles is the best side hustle ideas book for anyone who wants to start a side hustle without quitting their job What l loved the most are the inspiring and practical ideas Chris shared  with reallife examples of people doing them successfully After listening to this book  you will find at least one profitable side hustle idea that you can start right away I found more than one idea and highly recommend you get this book today  Even better  pair it with this book  Side Hustle From Idea to Income in 27 Days  to make the perfect combo for your side hustle  I saw the tv show before I saw the book so I was exited to see it was a written story  as they are usually better  Not really the case with this one  perhaps seeing the show tainted my expectations  but I was a little disappointed  I finished it because I thought it would take me beyond the first season of the show  but it actually ended much sooner  I am a 28 year old male  so I don t care for a ton of emotional love story stuff  I really don t mind a little  but the written book seemed to be way over the top  at least for me  14 year old girls will probably love it  I did like having two narrators  one for male characters and one for the females  that was a good touch  but over all I think the tv series is the real winner  So straight forward and clear to understand  Such a great read  Good to read so many times Liked that it was a long book  but I cant handle the narrator  Couldnt give the stories a chance  The stepbystep technique is fantastic  This book is really useful  and I would strongly suggest it  This book is extremely great  and it provides a lot of new and efficient Emotional Intelligence techniques and information  Quotes can make you laugh  ponder their wisdom  cry  think beyond our shallow thinking  uplift  comfort  I enjoy all these feelings when I come upon these thoughtful words  My favorite  listened to it twice now  This will help you be grateful and will help with whats weighing you down and stopping you from full potential This book was short but cute and sweet  It didnt really feel rushed either when novellas can I liked the tie to the sisters story too  Love this whole series The narrators were good but not my favorite Lee Samuels I will happily seek out more of Joan Delaware has a lovely voice but shes just not my style  I LOVED this book right from the beginning to the end  I love Smithy and everything he tells Lottie Lottie is exactly how I remember her from the RC books  3Mo oh Mo is PERFECT for Lottie I love him and how he falls for her  All at once it was beautiful  These kinds of books just make me love romance that much more than I did before Mos family omg both his blood and the ones he surrounds himself with I cant wait for this new series I hope we get some of them  if not all  3Ok  we have to talk about TEX he made me have a tear  I loved his scene with Lottie and Smithy  I swear and that song I looked it up and listened this morning THE TEARS  3I LOVED Susannahs narration I always have she just brings so much to each of these characters in a way that you always know who is speaking and whos pov we are in I love her  really helped me prepare for NCLEX during on the go time  Used during walks  treadmill  and driving  Good questions   Are you looking for a girl s name  You have no idea  This is a good book to tell you the new name of your upcoming daughter  or for a friend upcoming baby There is even the meaning of the first names  and some special name  Well done to the author  A great book for beginners  My spanish went from 0 to communicate in one week  or two   The author walks you through the tricky grammar and different verb tenses easily and makes learning Spanish enjoyable  In the description if this book  it indicates that vocabulary lists and conversation summaries are available  They are not  I am unable to locate an accompanying PDF  nor is there any place on the recording that gives these summaries of the conversations  nor was I able to locate vocabulary lists  What a HUGE disappointment  This feels like such a potential for helping with listening skills  but since the parts that would help decode what I cant quite understand are missing  Im kinda feeling ripped off  This would be too easy for someone who doesnt need a little help  but its too challenging for someone who does Edit I just got in touch with the author of this book  and found out you can PURCHASE the written version as a kindle download  It should have come free as a PDF  which is what most language audible books do   Not expensive  but just an update so you will know before getting this book  This is a great addition to a course of learning Spanish  This plus Pimsleur  Excellent  I love the story so much  Not a compliment or concern or comment  just saying in most of the books your Mrs  was actually Pandita  I don t care though  the classic tale  I love this  good material but way too brief and very repetitive  she could have elaborated more on important points instead of repeating the same thing multiple times  This is a great book to have and listen to over a period of time or all at once like you would read any other book  The stories were inspiring and uplifting and on dark days it was a great reminder to be grateful for everything you have  an amazing read  an essential for any trader  worth the long hours  will read again 100  This is the first of Robin s books I ve listened to  or read  I felt a lot of what he said was good  but he refers to his other books a bit too much  trying to sell them None of the things he mentions in the book are groundbreaking either  mostly just good common sense put into words  This is a simple way of sharing your faith Biblically  Talks about using the law  specifically the 10 commandments  to bring the knowledge of sin  Once the person is convicted of their sin you can share the good news of the Gospel  The book has summary questions and answers at the end of each chapter to help you learn the material as well  This audiobook was very easy to listen to and to learn from  I highly recommend it  I think this book is meant for those who are not use to reading intellectual habit changing self help books  I would recommend Atomic Habits  This book just talks about his journey  and to be honest  he hasnt accomplished that much  I would recommend you listen to an author who has gone through more  and accomplished more in life  However  that doesnt mean he is bad or unsuccessful  What I mean is that this author cannot give you science and research backed advise  Hes only stating experiences from his life  and I dont know how much thats valuable  since he is still on his journey to the top  My take away from this book  just dont give up  This book has enlightened me about spiritual warfare and the demonic forces  I always knew there was a such thing but not on this level  I can now fight my way through right thinking and words  Thank you so much  you are truly led my God  Filled with tons of gems you can take away from this book I liked how this book didn t have so much fluff some self help books have that makes them to long and go over the same things over and over  thats why i really enjoyed this book Awesome book but somewhat repetitive  101ways could have been condensed into 60 ways  The author simply explained different aspects of the same way in different parts of the book  Inspite of the book being repetitive  the quality was great  definitely worth the money and the time listening  Wayne Dyer is truly an earth spirit  I have a lot of his CDs  His audios books are an inspiration for all of us who sometimes get lost along the way  or we are struggling with the illusion that  this is all there is   Mr Dyer literally simplifies our personal worlds with his freeflowing words  He has been my mentor for almost 3 years   his audios CDs have totally inspired me on levels that even surprise me  I have all of his audios on my iPod so I can simply turn it on  whenever  I need a  fix  for any issue  Truly an amazing soul  What a fun and interesting audiobook  I learned lots of Canadian French expressions  some are really entertaining and will definitely help me when on my travels  This book will help guide learners with simple words and sentences that are easy to understand  Excellently narrated and kept me entertained throughout  I would strongly recommend for people visiting any FrenchCanadian regions of Canada  I don t know  D you ever do it  Find yourself looking back at something that caused you great pain agony  I was on a 9 11 kick watched a lot of old vids  read a lot of old articles  and listened to a lot of audiobooks  Read  102 Minutes  ages ago and listened to the audiobook  and it holds up well  made me wince quite a bit  relive some of the nightmare of that day  ya know  What we learned Because  102 Minutes The Untold Story of the Fight to Survive Inside the Twin Towers  is nothing if not a story of what went wrong  what went right  what happened  Period And it is ohso cringeworthy Radios that wouldn t work  Radios on different frequencies  varying from agency to agency  Too few stairwells  some caved in by rubble  Oh  but some stairwells decently lit  Yay  We learned THAT from the FIRST time the towers were bombed   Firefighters damned near having heart attacks from the heat and the weight of their gear  Trying to be heard over the wail of sirens the crashing of bodies falling on the canopies or the ground  A man in a wheelchair patiently waiting  waiting  waiting with a friend  Sure  SOMEone will be by to rescue him  Right But there WERE many rescues  There WERE many good decisions  There WERE many dodged bullets It s just that   Well  it makes for a sometimes painful  but ALWAYS an amazing  worthwhile listen  I appreciate many of Pemas booksthis is a favorite  Challenging ideas  encouraging and something I listen to again and again  If your are a creative in the music business this book is a must read  I ve listened to it 4 times already and working on my fifth go around  It raises your situational awareness concerning your business and that  to me  makes it extremely valuable  huge intro very little substance  I think the good reviews come from a marketing campaign not real readers   don t waste your time and credit Thanks audible for making this a free download  It s a great reminder for this great speech These are great first listens for emerging readers  They are short enough for children who aren t used to audiobooks and I find that kids ask to listen to them several times  I find the Clifford recordings also work well when children listen and read along at the same time  To complicated for younglings  first time author audible  should be more interesting not a good bedtime story I love this book at bedtime  I want all the pigeon books on my kindle  This is such an odd story but we love having a good library of audiobooks with images to enjoy  We ve been slowly going through and buying the audible books from the With Synchronized Images category and have found that some are miscategorized and don t have images  This one DOES have the original illustrations and we just love that  Great education book for kids to learn tradition of Jewish  It is well written and organized so kids can understand very well  Highly recommend it Our whole family has been delighted by this short little audio book  The music and sound effects are perfect  not too sparse  not over the top  and listening to the narration  you will be convinced there are two different actors reading  We most often listen to children s audio books in the car  so there s something of a captive audience  With some of those books  I feel bad subjecting adults and older children to the rendition  Not this one  Occupants of all ages get a chuckle out of this reading of Green Eggs and Ham  Highly recommended  I love that my son wants to listen to his favorite books when we re in the car  and Where the Wild Things Are is always his 1 pick  Even better  he gets to see the illustrations from this beloved classic while we re listening  and it s just the right length to get us to the grocery store  Narrarated beautifully and loved the music that always makes an audible better  I paid 3 dollars for 3 minutes  thats highway robbery  i should get 3 books for that cost  Beautiful writing and characters    so surprising to see what quality can be packed into such a short story  I absolutely loved the mystical feeling surrounding this  as well as other stories by this author  Dina does a lovely job blending a sense of the magical with the everyday  Hope to see more from this author  My daughter loved this story and I loved that it was quick  the perfect length for transitioning to another activity  An adorable tale with an enthusiastic  engaging narrator to carry it along  Very sweet  Kids will love it  My daughters listened to it twice as we got it and they loved it  it s a super cute story with funny sound effects and music  We ve been slowly going through and buying the audible books from the With Synchronized Images category and have found that some are miscategorized and don t have images  This one DOES have the original illustrations and we just love it  This was one of my favorite books as a child and I love that I can share it with my kid  with fun and engaging music  I hope that in the future we can see the text  with highlights  to read along as some kids  apps have started offering  Was a cute story  given 5  by my 7 year old  I took off a star overall because the audiobook doesn t include the illustrations  Would you consider the audio edition of The Plan to be better than the print version  it was misleading on the page we ordered from   we thought it was a much longer reading the chapters are 1 minute each and each start with an announcement that it s a new chapter  whuch breaks up the flow of a short bedtime story  then it ends with a loud  audible hopes you have enjoyed this story  which I sort of had until that line made my 4 year old open his eyes and sit up  Peter Rabbit is one of my childhood favorites  and Emma Messenger only makes it better  Loved how she draws out the words when this  naughty  rabbit is stuck under the fence  How she portrays him panting  and losing hope  Excellent performance  good pace  clear and comprehensible  Should be easy for children to visualize the story  picturing Farmer McGregor  the encouraging birds  the  good  bunnies at home under the tree Beatrix Potter  Famous British author  illustrator  and naturalist  A century ago  she really had a mischievous rabbit named Peter  according to the official BP website  He napped in front of her fireplace on a blue blanket  Hence  his fictional facsimile wears a blue jacket Well  he did have a blue jacket  until today  when he got caught stealing greens in Mr  McGregor s garden  I have listened to this about 100 times with my two year old  I love Dion Graham s narration  The story is great for kids  though I have my quibbles  does the small skid steer who  does a trick  have to be gendered female     8 months old granddaughter loved it  Good for introducing rhyming words and for children who can can t read  My girls  age 5 and 7  absolutely love this book  I do too  We have listened to it multiple times  They wanted to see the pictures  so we found a YouTube video  and they did NOT like the readers voice  We returned to this  narrated by Kirby Heyborne  As soon as they heard his voice  they both replied  ahhhhhhh  in his voice  and mentioned how much they missed him We love all the books in this series   it turns out while I thought this was a seven hour long analysis it in fact was only 7 minutes  Shame on me for not paying more attention I guess audible will allow anybody to sell an audiobook analysis  my grandson is always asleep before the end so it is perfect  for us Thanks For me  this was a supernatural revelation that opened up the passage in ways that were never apparent before  The woman at the well story is a great story because of how Jesus crossed barriers to converse with the Samaritan  The author painted a dynamic picture here by explaining the meaning of the metaphors  I loved the analysis of the concrete language  To hear about the historical context  added so much more meaning for me  Great job with narration and easytofollow writing  I am giving this to my Lutheran pastor friend so he might use this for an upcoming sermon  Thank you  I am very happy I found this book because it really helped to improve our relationship with god and allocate some time for prayers before bedtime  My daughters also enjoyed this audiobook  My kids like listening to this  And love Gwyneth Paltrows performance  She should more narrating We ve been slowly going through and buying the audible books from the With Synchronized Images category and have found that some are miscategorized and don t have images  This one DOES have the original illustrations and we just love it  If you have a kid that likes Curious George this is worth a purchase  My boys love it  And the narrator and production is charming  I wish they did more   I have the hard copy  but it feels so personal hearing it from the authors voice  He did such a beautiful job  My son and i listened to the story and aside from him wanting cotton candy pancakes  he overall understood the message coming from the story  Please be kind to one another  one act of kindness can go a very long way  When you have a wellbalanced mind  you can have deep and fulfilling relationships  It can also help you to be more sociable and excel in your career  This book will get you there  So get a copy  today   I loved this audible and know it will be the key to successfully quitting smoking  it s a must for anyone struggling to quit  Really liked it made me feel strong and confident liked tine tips to get through the cravings  There isn t going to be much for me to add to what has already been said about this book and these two authors  It may be an older title  and some of the examples given in the book reference companies that are no longer in existence but the core ideas  values  and lessons remain timeless  There are so many reasons to like this book Mr  Linville ask a question and then after giving you time to answer them he gives you a solid explanation  but still encourages the child to come up with more of his own answers any ciao asked to be very loved if an adult in their life buys them this book  You and the child will learn what type of people or bullies and how to respond to a bully  His ongoing message and whats most important is to always stay safe and to go to an adult  This is a great book in one parents and teachers should get long before the bullying starts  You could prevent a child from being a bully or another child from continuously getting bullied  There is loud music playing over the story  My kids were super distracted and lost interest almost immediately  Bummed because they love this story  but this version is very hard to listen to  Packed full of practical advice  and an enjoyable listen  Extremely relevant information and nuggets to help improve productivity  very good very easy I like it allot better than other s I ve tried for sure The book is helpful  The Power of SelfDiscipline comes with powerful tools you need to know for longterm success  You can start experiencing amazing results fast  So you need to have this book in your library  So  buy it now  Going though exactly what the story was mentioning  I suffer from bipolar  ADHD  Tourette s  sever depression  OCD  maybe narsasitic behavior  This book gives me a positive vibes on how to better myself and most of all  my 3 yr old  My heart hurts because she has to witness my rage  MUST READ     What would have made Learn Spanish with Innovative Language s Proven Language System  Level 2 Absolute Beginner Spanish better  It seems such an easy way to get rid of the old way of thinking and wow does it show me how much thinking I have  The narrated has a great voice that definitely helps to listen to I thought this would dive in a tad deeper and help me skip the entire book  It didn t work  Now I want more  Love the story but what kid has the patience to sit through all the music  Would you try another book from Innovative Language Learning and or Alan La Rue and Lizy Stoliar   My little one is 4  we have Pete the Cat books  she has Pete the Cat pajamas  absolutely loves all things Pete the Cat  She loved listening to the books  We actually have a few of these stories at home  so its nice for her to follow along in the physical book while listening to it when Im busy with something or when we are driving in the car  this is so short and needs more explanation   I am korean American and already understand most of the words  Our nation is drowning in debt  At the same time countless people want more  Listen to this simple book to gain wisdom regarding this situation and our best options for the future  To fast girl just reading sentences in her own fast way  No space for repeating Not happy at all  Cost is to high  Spam   Just an add for the lessons  Waste of time  You would think a sample of actual lessons would be a good idea but these are just five to 45minute advertisements for the lessons you get no actual feel of the content  It s just an advertisement  Don t loose your time  honestly Thanks for nothing  Innovative  Uninstalling your app in 3  2  1    This was mostly an ad  and wasn t at all appealing  I would recommend other French language learning that is available on Audible this was the least engaging for me  I was excited to see this title  hoping it would help me define Asperger s for me  Well it did not do that at all  I am the mother of 8 children    I felt many of these traits are traits that can be seen in many children at different stages of development    This book is not the book to comfort or to clarify Autism Spectrum Disorders After hearing a few of the traits that were so general   I found myself not believing the rest of the traits at all  questioning the darn disorder  YA GITZ DIS ERE IZ AH GOOD FER LISTIN  GIT IT YA GROTZ  WAAAAAAAAAAGH  FER GORK N MORK  Great 40k Ork fun  I had a smile on my face the whole time listening to this  This review is better structured and more clear than others  It is still no substitute for the book  As it and other reviews have noted it is written for lay readers and perhaps targeting those who have experienced or know someone who has experienced trauma  This is a significant percentage of our society  The point that the reviews seem to miss is that if a person has experienced or been exposed to those with trauma  the tools in part three of the book are most useful in providing options for treatment  useful therapy  and a sense of hope that one can move past trauma and properly integrate memories and traumatic experience in a way that allows a peaceful and functional life that can be filled with intimacy and joy in family and friends  Helping people process trauma and live productive lives brings great value to individuals and societies  The book original book is written in a manner that is therapeutic and a way that can provide hope and a way to move from trauma to the light  The review  though useful as a starting  is more like looking at the reflection of the moon in the pond when you can see its full beauty by looking into the sky  Please read the original  it is well worth the time invested  However  I have found that in sharing it with friends  some are not able to easily process the material because it causes memories of their own trauma to surface  I recommend reading slowly and using the tools discussed in the text  Not the best format for learning foreign languages  I found it not as easy as say the Pimleur s methods  Wouldnt recommend for ppl like sslf I wish it would have been more about the 5 things and not about the author This is a great start to preparing us for the rise of the robots  I ve been keeping my eyes on this occurence and think its someting that we need to prepare for sooner rather than later  The rise of robots in our society is accelerating and exponential  Forewarned is forearmed  I m revisiting the getting things done book so I was hoping for a good summary that could speed up my implementation of the process I think this one needs to be updated  Very dark very important  Every one should read this in light of our systems of social controls employed today  The history we don t know we are probably repeating already  We can t move forward with out looking back  We must see even through red eyes this book was very to the point  as well as very easy to understand  id recommend the book high value take aways collaboration  coaching  breaking down complexity  being focused on top priority  prevention   automation   quite holistic and timeless wisdom this is a really great book shows you different things to think about and consider it shows you where you stand and it helps you to realize emotional things that you didn t know what s going on she doesn t tell you what to do she lets you figure it out by answering the questions yourself Loved it  and I also loved when the reader made a mistake in the recording  and had a  dag nabbit  moment  haha  but pressed on    Drucker describes extremely clearly what effective executives all have in common  And he iterates that regardless of your personality traits  you can still run a successful company if you are an effective leader with strong leadership skills  He talks about what those skills are without a bunch of motivational fluff you see in other books  Everything in this book is valuable  I never had this read to me as a child  How wonderful to have it read to me now by Mr  Armitage  he made me feel young again  To be fair to the people at Innovative Language  don t crp all over them due to a technical issue on Audible s part  I usually download audio books in Format 4  That version came in corrupt  and I was only able to hear   This is Audible   The Enhanced version works perfectly Also this is a short  free preview of their box set  which is a rehash of the audio content from Japanesepod101  This maybe more convenient to a few of us  As far as content goes  this is great for the beginner  Maybe even better than Pimsluer s Japanese  I still believe you should use more than one program to learn a language because different programs will tackle a language from different angles  But if you re a newbie  this series is a great start  Then I would incorporate Micheal Thomas  Later on Pimsluer s  As you learn  also immerse yourself in Japanese culture and media   websites  KeyHileTV  manga  etc  Also learn Kana  Katakana  and Hiragana Don t take my word for it  download all of the freebees  and try out the lessons for yourself  Concise  efficient delivery of info  No fluff  Gave good suggestions for resources to further development  It s a must for people with children  The story is fun filled and entertaining for all ages  My daughter is 8 and we listen to it every night at bed time  She also has the book she reads along  It s a lovely short story  I ve never heard Isabel Allende s voice before and I loved it It is story of a man who falls in love with a statue  but it s another kind of love  The statue was the most beautiful thing he ever saw and she made him rethink all the life he had lived  She made him appreciate more the things around him  Loved this Reminds us of just how far Magnus will go to serve his own moral compass  I suspect he seeks redemption not only from his sons  but his father in this  This story hints at a path to that redemption  Thousand Sons fans must listen to this  First off  english is not my main language  so please forgive any misspelling in this review  The style of this book actually would force you to relisten to it if you re actually going to try any of the aformentioned  Magic Spells for Wealth  Prosperity and Money   I won t It s a light listen  if you re not into ocult  you might skip it  But there are a few bits on history on the culture of ancient civilazations that are interesting and hard to find elsewhere  I listened to it because of curiosity  even though skeptical I can see people could benefit from the positive thinking that any of the spells would at the very least bring  Don t do it if you don t trully believe it  and it might take some time to work   Is one of the most honest lines in there  Since the author probably is aware of people wanting a  miracle solution  Honestly  I expected less from the narration because of the topic  length and rating  But he does have a great voice If you re into the ocult  you might find yourself wanting to do a few  in a sumary they re all  Don t ask for more than you actually need and don t expect money to just be given to you  expect good results in what you re doing  So if you believe that these spells or lucky charms would actually benefit you  at least don t expect a miracle If you don t  you might learn something interesting historicaly tldr It s not for me  but it wasn t bad  This is the book every successseeking person needs to have  Learn how to get out of your comfort zone and enjoy it  But above all  get the results you always wanted  This is a musthave book  So grab one now before there re gone  This speech never loses potency or relevence  A soul stinging listen that I will assuredly recommend to all who admire and agree with the the efforts and stance of Dr Martin Luther  The King  Jr   I love Phillip Pullman but this would be better in a collection of short stories on Audible  I love how this book is nice and short and gets to the point  Trying to get better with focus would have been hard if I had to try to focus on a lengthy book Each chapter is only a few minutes long and provide great tips without a bunch of fluff which really allowed me to make my first steps in learning to focus  I ve always enjoyed The Sentinel  The writing is very tight and flows very well  The narrator  Ralph Lister  does a great job telling it  I ll be looking for more stories narrated by him  CON This particular audiobook cuts out every few minutes  At first I thought it was my computer however  I rebooted my computer and the audio still cut out  So  I listened to it on my phone and guess what   it cut out as well  Perfect for parents who don t have time to sit and listen to anecdotes and filler    will definitely be attempting to use these techniques with my own children  I am an admirer of Dalio  and I haven t read the summarized book  so this deals narrowly with what I got from this summary  The four tools identified to deal with debt in the big picture  and the balancing act of managing with those tools  as heard in the  sample   was a neat compact idea  That s why I bought the summary  expecting more on this level  The remaining content of this summary was OK  but it was all really basic historical stuff  familiar and obvious to me  as a person who has studied this topic at some length  If I had it to do over again  I would just listen to the free sample  Please use your credit to this book  This a good book that is worth listening to Short yet helpful  Not only is this a great little book  but Clay Lamakayu does a very nice job with the narration  Years ago I read most of Neville s books  but it s so nice to get to listen to them now  It is very intriguing but for those of you who are new to audio books  this is a recap not the actual book  I should have read the cover description better    A short  refreshing audiobook  a lot of wisdom in this concise book  Based on the science of thought and meditation on God  Thank you for this succinct and helpful audiobook  An Audible member since the early days  Ive bought over 700 titles and listened to most of my library several times  Ive enjoyed countless hours of pleasure and brought many new members to this platform because I love it so much  Im also an author  When I won the battle in 2016 to regain my rights from my original publisher  I did so with the express intention of releasing an audio version  I hired a wonderful actor to perform the novel  learning much in the process  I only wish Id had the benefit of this small book before undertaking that project  In my worksinprogress  a multigenre mystery series  Im incorporating much of the wisdom you share here and look forward to learning even more about the art of creating wonderful listening experiences  This audio book is very much a readalong book  I wondered  before I bought it  how they could convert these books into audio books and now I know  It doesn t make much sense without having the physical book in front of you as well  With the book in hand  this is a good audio book and I suppose it would be useful to read to kids when a grownup isn t available  A great short story by Poe  Whetter its a beating heart or a noisy cat  the murders in Poes stories learn crime never pays  I haven t enjoyed a book this much in years  A unique idea  dating from an Aspie s perspective  Simsion has a knack for characters and storytelling and Lee Stayer was an excellent reader  It discusses the basic principles of establishing the mindset of the wealthy  it s pretty good  I mistakenly thought this was going to be an actual book about the history of Gay Rights in America and the history of Pride Month  but its just a podcast I was hoping for more history  more context  more of a wellrounded explanation of Pride and its not even an hour long  I thoroughly enjoyed listening  The author   Bill Johnson  has become one of my favorite scribes on the things of God  It is a short book   and went fast   and so I put it on repeat   even in the night  so I could absorb it   what the hell  I spent a 13 dollar credit on a 20 minute story  I was disappointed  I was so into the story and love the author but when it ended I was left feeling shortchanged  I wait for credits  pay for credits and they are priceless  when comparing this brief experience with something like Michelle Obama Becoming  you ve got to be kidding  provide appropriate content for the money invested  boo  on you  I believe I listened to this at least 6x  mostly at 1 25 speed  but played the last at 1 0  and there is still so much I didnt understand or absorb  There is a surprising amount of medically technical and evolutionary info re the Pineal Gland which would have benefited from a good diagram  PDF anyone  I think it was the author bouncing between different spiritual pantheons on top of everything else that finally did me in Riddle has a pleasant voice but is hitormiss on pronunciations as simple as esoteric and protuberance  groan  He correctly pronounces one word in French then massacres Descartes  Yet Riddle seems to hold his own with the medical jargon  Go figure  What did you like best about Curious George Rides a Bike  The Little Red Hen  14 Rats and a Rat Catcher  and more  What did you like least  I love it  the narrator is excellentfirst audible book I still finish  So awesome  I love the 3 points I will apply them  Curiosity  Empathy and Courage  As someone who has only learned negative attitudes as a way to motivate and push myself into what I think I should be or do  I had not only created my own longstanding depression  but also extreme and repeated selfsabotage  This meditation was the first selfhelp recording that I had listened to in my attempt to turn my life around  Despite what I intellectually knew about why I was behaving a certain way and that the supposed answer was to  love yourself   I didn t know where to start    or why my therapist even thought I didn t love myself   You need to have forgiveness and compassion for yourself   she said several years ago  I had eventually stopped seeing her  as I saw no improvement in my behavior after many years of talk  After a life changing event  I knew there was no running from my issues and I set out to undertake in my own healing  I came upon a book that helped me understand that everyone has a relationship with themselves  whether aware or not  there were attitudes  expectations and assumptions that dictated how life was going to be handled  For the first time I saw just how damaging my inner dialog was  I learned the path to healing would be to reparent myself  How was I going to do that  Well  this tape was a wonderful stepping stone for getting me in touch with my inner child  For the first time I was able to acknowledge her and miraculously  compassion and forgiveness just came naturally  It wasn t that I didn t love myself  I had just never been taught what healthy love looked like  If you are trying to form a conscious relationship with yourself  having difficulty with the concept of  loving yourself   or have problems accepting that vulnerability is not a reflection of selfworth  I feel this tape could help you frame things in a way that will allow you to see yourself in a different brighter light  Well wishes for you on you path to self healing 3   As described this is the narrative audiobook is wise to buy the book or the true audiobook  This book does paint a decent picture as far as steps to take  It mentions Ubuntu Linux which is a good operating system  I won t argue that  Kali Linux is what I use and is extremely used in the hacking community and very well known and extremely easy to understand  A programming language is pretty useful to know but a requirement  Not so much  Just a basic understanding of a operating system designed for hacking is what is mainly needed  If your getting into hacking  read this book but don t follow every single step  There are tons of resources on the web  Other than that  this book is useful  Good buy If you re interested in an high level overview of the love languages  I would definitely recommend that you check this out  i have alot of left leanning friends that always make fun of me for being right leanning  this helped me to hone my thoughts into the topics we discus and get my point across  really liked the original book and thought I may get some key notes from this one to help younger leaders in training  waste of money here  While I realize there is so much more in the full book  Flashnotes is perfect  For 1 97 and 30 minutes of your time you can pay to listen to an advertisement created to peak your curiosity enough to lure you straight to this author s Facebook page and business website    Aahh The information provided here can easily be found on the Internet using key phrase searches such as pendulum divination  dowsing etc   I was seeking a brief refresher to dowsing by use of a pendulum  but found myself reading an advertisement instead  Two dollars is a generous price for anyone seeking a quick refresher of knowledge forgotten over time  Unfortunately  this is not what I received  Rather  I received an eyeopening lesson I will not so easily forget  This book is about a new maid brought in by her cousin  The duke takes under his wing sexually  At first it appeared he treated her like a slave and humiliated her but by the end you knew it was part of the game  He had the maid fooled because he was so convincing Candace Young did a good job with the narration  I was given this free copy audiobook at my request and have voluntarily left this review  I bought this book hoping to learn more about idioms and expressions  It just contains a short story with dialogues  after you listen to it  you probably forgot most of them  just a summary  but interesting  read reviews  it give an interesting look  but I wish it was the essay itself  Great storyline with a big message that inspires the story beyond adventure  I dont think this audiobook is just for children but adults as well  We all can learn a thing or two from the adventures of Angus the mouse  This storybook is really interesting for kids  When they will go for sleep and read the stories then it will give them a relaxed brain and also increase their imagination power  So grab this book for your kids  This audio book has caught my mind  Included diet plan are really awesome  You can get it as what you want  I was feeling bored but after listening this audio book I am fully changed  My weight is now on maintain  So listen this audio book and start with keto diet  Fantastic  Nice addition to my research  Recommend for those on this journey of an empath  Continue educating yourself and expanding my beloved  I bow to your spirit  Be blessed  This is without a doubt the best book Ive read  listened to  about America explaining the Grand Canyon Divide of the Left from the Right Great Historic back up  timelines  and sequencing presented  Many people are familiar with a part of Chuck Yeager s life from the movie  The Right Stuff   Let s say that  while very entertaining  the movie does not get everything right  The real story is even more interesting Chuck s adventures in through World War II would alone also make an almost unbelievable movie  Chuck was a double ace and once shot down five planes in one day  On top of that he bailed out and had a harrowing escape through the underground  Amazing When Chuck broke the sound barrier after the war  he was only  by my count 24 or 25  He then did more test flying  and then led squadrons in Germany and elsewhere  All along the way  he met the icons of the age and had many colorful friends and admirers  including Pancho Barnes and Jackie Cochran  There is just one amazing story after another The book ends in the 1980s  As this review is written  Chuck is still with us at 97  A true American hero This is a great book  The narration is mainly in the first person by  Chuck  with excerpts from his wife Glynnis and others  not the real peopleprofessional narrators playing their parts   It is well done  This book will assist you with learning change your contemplations and mentality  Something significant  as I would like to think  that is covered here is assessing the organization you keep  Very nice book  I loved him Keto Air Fryer Cookbook    Very cool   ThanK YOU I have bulimia problems  although it is hard for me to accept it and I am currently in therapy to get out of this difficult problem  This book caught my attention and the first topic I listened to was the one dedicated to eating disorders  It has given me a lot of strength and courage and now I have more mastery and control of my body and it has been incredibly good for me  I am eternally grateful to the author  the meditation has helped me  and it is no lie  If you want to get started

of years  of which I unexpectedly came across Paul Selig s books and lectures  Something rang true for me from the getgo  I just knew I was led to these teachings  They  the teachings  the guides  the

and what I am    in my Divinity and to see God in everyone and all things  I always knew  I just forgot  I had inklings of curiosity and interests that were like breadcrumbs setting the path for most of my life  Even as a little girl  I knew  I just didn t know how to fully articulate it  To express it  And into my adolescence and adulthood  I was held back in fear  I realize it was the fear that was the blindspot  Now  at 58 earth years  I am seeing clearly in the light of truth  Of all the teachings so far  Alchemy has given me a deeper understanding of not only who and what I am but the awareness of the immense ability we all have to transform the fear  see the truth within all things beyond what we thought we knew  and to reknow everything we encounter from a higher consciousness or state of being  they call the upper room  In this true state of being  I am released from confusion  doubt  fear  shame  guilt  et al    because it doesn t exist at this octave or level of perception  I am here  finally  in my knowing  I feel it  I am my true self  Love  God  divinity  no name necessary  as who and what I am in truth  Yes  I am still a human having her journey on this planet with

aspects of God that have brought me to this realization  I honor all in Love  This book is amazing  great quality and the whole family loves all the recipes  It is truly inspiring that you can take

well   Made me realize a lot about my self and my lack of discipline  I recommend for all those actively pursuing a better life for themselves  This audio book is a great listen for those who are new

SischoHansen rated a book it was amazing10 days agoJust Jones by Andy AndrewsJust Jones Sometimes a Thing Is Impossible       Until   by Andy Andrews  Goodreads Author ReadRead in September 2020Wow What A StoryI love a good story  This new book  Just Jones by Andy Andrews is a good story  I have enjoyed meeting and getting to know Jones through the books and this story introduces us to even more Jones I started thinking at the beginning of the book who is the Jones in my life and actually Ive had many  not just one person  Then I think who have I been a Jones to and am glad to remember that there have been a few people I have touched  I have been given to and given out and that is in part what this story is about Andy mentions in the interview at the end of the audio book that he wanted to give people something to talk about and he has followed through with that goal I love the references to the Andy Griffith show and the applications he incorporates in each of his stories but especially the Jones books This story does not disappoint  And can be read  listened to many times to always glean something else from  I energetically prescribe you to listen to this book in the

book slowly eases you into meal prep by starting off with breakfast and lunch and then moving on to include dinner and snacks  Voddie is an amazing man of God  Oh how I have been in need of this book  It has been and will be so precious to me in arranging our family to please God  Thank you pastor  I was glad as well for the narrator because of him sounding similar to Voddie  well done  While this book is well written and covers its material well  it limits itself to only a couple of the applications of COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY theory  It s easy to follow and very helpful in understanding yourself and those around you  Highly recommend  Thanks for author I have used R for a few years and this was my first book that covered Python for data science  Even though it does not go into super great depth in any area  it is definitely a super book  The exchange of options at the beginning of this business is very important  that s why thisaudiobook offers a unique opportunity to the listener  because through its teachings  as abeginner  I am learning faster to master these exchanges  Thanks  Explanations and exercises follow each sample conversation  This is not primarily a book for beginners  though a brief appendix in the back of the book covers basic grammar  conjugations  pronouns  etc  Our class  which includes students of many different levels of ability  is using this book  and we are all enthusiastic about it  I find this one of THE most helpful books I have ever used  and I am a perennial student of Spanish  I love this audiobook  It gave me a lot of information on how to properly trade my money  when to trade and when not to trade  The concepts can be a bit hard to grasp at first  but the examples make them much more clear  and the examples demonstrate the power of risk management  The book was a decent perused and the cash the executives bodes well with frameworks that hit streaks  Valuable lessons insights broken into days of the month  It takes 21 days to form a new habit  working on EQ over 21 days is a great start to forming stronger habits in building your EQ  This book is exactly what I needed to hear  Incredibly helpful and super

of what a good book is  It teaches you exactly what to do  All has been clear and straight to the point I can say it is the teacher I was looking for Highly recommended  This audio book is not designed to be a comprehensive study into the science of day trading  Rather  it provides the interested student with the essential fundamentals Theres a ton of information and products out there for consumers to choose from  and in order for yours to stand out above the rest  youve got to have a plan  This book gives you a sevenstep plan for creating social media content that people enjoy and  more importantly  that drives clicks and sales  Dont write another article  record another podcast or shoot another video until you have a plan for how youre going to send it out into the universe  I

an invaluable help and the narration is just perfect  Extremely useful content  definitely a must buy   Short and easy to understand  No complicated words  Was able to understand all the words I was listening  It s awesome  being able to listen to the author read his own book was a treasure  This book gives you a desire to go to see into the Spiritual realm  Plus it gives you the steps needed to practice  I would recommend this book to everyone  His first book The Veil gave you a taste but this book gives you the meat  Stoics fascinated me for a long time  This book provides a great introduction to Stoicism as a life philosophy  Recommend it for everyone  The audible is very detailed in different ways to work on yourself and to fix the weight troubles you are facing  This audible gives some excellent tips rather than the typical weight loss audible  Great informative book about emotional intelligence for the beginners  To follow this book you will easily learn how to influence people  improve your social skills and achieve a happier relationship  I am so much satisfied and I will highly recommend it to all my friends  What I enjoyed about the book is that the author used simple examples outside the business world to make you understand all the basic concepts  This helped me to see the financial markets as something familiar I also really liked his approach to options strategies  He says that options trading is a bit more complicated to learn and that the learning curve can be steep at times  However  he also points out that after a while it all makes sense and becomes easy  I thought this approach made the author and his book trustworthy Full of information on how to be successful in options trading  Even the strategies are super easy to understand and follow  This book is a wonderful starting point if you have any interest in  or curiosity about Memory Improvement  Its interesting and explains it clearly  Impressive audiobook with a plethora of affirmations to get your thinking about success and money in a healthy way  great summary of everything I will do to have a good attitude  life the book was a blockbuster summary of everything I will do  since I want to be happy  to keep my mental health health So far  this book has helped me understand myself better and connect more deeply with my partner  I recommend it to anyone in a long term relationship who wants to foster a more trusting and open relationship  Excellent book   Couldn t believe how effective this book was  I love anything written by Brian  he is incredibly down to earth yet educated and informed researcher  This book has the most misleading title  The first chapter was a sales pitch with numerous top ten lists about why this was the best book why you should learn french etc  Each chapter has a very long intro that was a total waste of time  Without the PDF its worthless  I bought this to actually learn French  I don t need 15 minutes of explanation why this is the best FRENCH BOOK of all time  I am going back to a book that actually teaches french phrases because this book will bore you to tears before you can say Bon Jour Given that we are living in an emotionally turbulent world  this book will help you tap into your subconscious mind and know how to deal with people and listen their body language  leading to better people skills  Fortunately  this audiobook has completely enhanced my sex life  Not only have I learned new positions and techniques  but also ideas and concepts that have challenged my old ways of thinking  This audio book is splendid  I inclined such huge numbers of successful things from this audio book  With completely smooth composition  I loved the book  I was in the army and my uncle served in the unit  We as a family had no idea of what he did or the units history  It was never spoken of in the family  From the South Side of Chicago to the WHITE HOUSE  Whew  Let that sink in  As a black woman  this book moved me differently than any other book Ive read in recent memory  Letting me know its ok that Im still Becoming and that I have the right to enter any space I want to  I loved Mrs  Obama before  but I was introduced to Michelle Robinson Obama and I love her even more  She read her own story like she was talking directly to me and I loved that  It was like sitting down at your Auntie House and she was telling you all tea over a good glass of wine  Im so thankful for her sharing her story and being so open and honest about it all  What a story '"
